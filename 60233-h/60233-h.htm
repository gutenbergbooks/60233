<h1 title="">THE GRAY SHADOW</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">HERE TO-DAY AND AWAY TO-MORROW</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Roll up! Tumble up! Anyway to get
up! If you can&rsquo;t get up, roll your
money up. For we&rsquo;re here to-day and away
to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This curious bit of philosophy coming from
the lips of Johnny Thompson, youthful world
traveler and adventurer, even to himself
seemed strange. Yet here he was barking his
wares at the &ldquo;Greatest of all Carnivals.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>He had learned those words at a county
fair when a boy of seven. That they were as
effective now as then was attested by the
crowds of men and women that thronged
about his booth. All were eager to place a
dime on the square and win (if luck were with
them) a basket of groceries at the turn of the
wheel of fortune that spun so freely at Johnny&rsquo;s
touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this business,&rdquo; Johnny had said
to a friend only an hour before. &ldquo;A few win.
The rest go away empty handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; his friend had agreed. &ldquo;But then,
after all, it&rsquo;s only a dime for each one. And
it&rsquo;s part of the carnival. Look at those people.
Do you ever think much about them?
Look at their faces. Not much of a life they
lead. The men work in factories putting bolts
into places; same kind of bolt in the same kind
of place all day long. Perhaps they lift a
casting from one place and drop it down in
another. The women stay at home and scrub
and cook. Carnival comes but once a year.
Let them have their fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s friend had cheered him up a bit
so he went about his barking with a smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to-day and away to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; he assured himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll flit
as soon as some big thing breaks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Ah, yes, that was it, &ldquo;some big thing.&rdquo;
Johnny was here for a purpose. The dimes
that came, the baskets of groceries that passed
over the counter, interested him very little.
He was looking all the time for faces, certain
faces, and thinking how he would mingle more
and more with the men and women who were
by profession followers of the Carnival. And
all this for one high purpose.</p>
<p>So now with the bright lights dazzling his
eyes and the incessant tumult of sounds, organs
grinding, hawkers hawking, merry-makers
screaming, he kept at his task of the moment,
shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to-day and away to-morrow.
Now! Round and round she goes. Where
she stops, nobody knows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he grumbled low to himself, &ldquo;I
give &rsquo;em something when they do win. No
clock that won&rsquo;t run, nor painted plaster-of-paris
doll for me. Real basket of groceries:
oatmeal, peas, canned fish and a picnic ham.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;There you are, lady!&rdquo; he shouted as the
wheel stopped on the lucky 15. &ldquo;Take this
home for your Sunday dinner.&rdquo; The crowd
laughed and applauded as a short, stout Italian
woman stumped away with her prize.</p>
<p>At that moment, from opposite directions,
two youths pressed into the throng, each to
deposit a dime on a favorite square. One was
rather tall and broad shouldered; the other
thin and of medium height. The one of athletic
build was dressed as a college youth, and
looked the part; latest stiff hat, bright tie,
natty brown suit and spats he wore. The
other seemed a freckle-faced country youth.
He wore a soft slouch hat. His clothes fitted
him badly. He even walked with that curious
stride that suggests the lifting of feet from
soft earth.</p>
<p>Johnny moved each dime to the center of
its square and twirled the wheel. As he did
so the college youth winked, and the freckled
one, talking from the side of his mouth, said
distinctly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all here. Greasy Thumb and his
gang. Saw &rsquo;em just now. Greasy is running a
wheel. Rest are cappers. Wonder why.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The next moment, without waiting to discover
the results of the wheel&rsquo;s turn, both college
boy and country youth disappeared into
the milling throng.</p>
<p>Johnny smiled, frowned, then gave himself
over to the business of tending a spindle wheel
at the &ldquo;Greatest of all Carnivals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The shouts and screams of the merry-makers
had subsided to a murmur. The raucous
grind of the merry-go-round organ was still.
Lights were low. The night&rsquo;s work was done.
Behind closed tents the concession holders
counted their nickels and dimes. Fat wives
quarreled with slim husbands and grumbled
about hard times that dwarfed their earnings.
Slender girls of doubtful age combed their peroxide-blonde
hair and flirted with boys in
tight fitting suits. From this tent came a gurgle
of laughter, from that a shout of derision.
For, after all, the Carnival King and his crowd
are as carefree a lot of ne&rsquo;er-do-wells as one
is likely to find in many a day&rsquo;s travel. There
is more truth than poetry in the expression so
often at the tips of their tongues: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
here to-day and away to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the life,&rdquo; Johnny murmured, as he
sauntered over the well-worn path that led
from booth to booth. &ldquo;And then again, I
wonder if it is. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off to stare ahead, for in
spite of the lateness of the hour he saw just
before him, crowded about a dimly lighted
booth, an interested and excited group of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky,&rdquo; said a short dark man with
a scar above his eyes, patting a slim man in
an ill-fitting suit on the back as Johnny arrived.
&ldquo;You paid only half a dollar. Now
see! You may win ten. Put down your dollar
quick before he stops the game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny recognized the swarthy individual
behind the spindle wheel. His wheel carried
cheap baubles while the lights were on. Now
only numbers remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing for money. Breaking the law,&rdquo; the
boy thought. &ldquo;Big stakes if he can get them.
Wonder if he could be Greasy Thumb?&rdquo; He
crowded closer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mister!&rdquo; pleaded the man with the
scar over his eye. &ldquo;Let me have his chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the ill-fitting suit squared his
shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it myself.&rdquo; He peeled
a sticky dollar bill off a meagre roll.</p>
<p>He played.</p>
<p>Johnny was disgusted. The man with the
scar was a capper, one of the gang of crooked
gamblers. He would lead this dupe on and on,
and finally take all his money and leave him
flat.</p>
<p>Johnny listened. They were at it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two calls for twenty-five. Oh, what luck!
You&rsquo;ll win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the ill-fitting suit plunged again,
and yet again. Twenty-five, fifty, a hundred
dollars lay on the board. But always it was
just beyond his reach. He must always pay
more to win. His roll grew slimmer. At last
only one bill remained, a fairly large one. He
hesitated, then plunged for the last time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ho! Too bad!&rdquo; The voice of the man
with the scar had gone flat. &ldquo;You lost again!&rdquo;
The face of the dupe showed his consternation.
He had lost a summer&rsquo;s savings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>But now a fresh voice broke into the game.
A broad-shouldered man with a stubby beard
thrust his face close to that of the spindle
wheel man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a crooked game,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I
know this man. He&rsquo;s a truck farmer. Got
five kids. He can&rsquo;t afford to lose. You&rsquo;ve
robbed him. But you can&rsquo;t get away with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put out a hand for the money still on the
table. But his grasp fell a foot short. With
a grunt and a groan he went down. From beneath
the table, by a well-practiced trick, the
crook had kicked him in the stomach.</p>
<p>The affair seemed over. It was not. Johnny
was to be reckoned with. He was fast as
lightning and hard as nails. &ldquo;Strike first, and
take the second,&rdquo; was his motto. The gambler&rsquo;s
foot was not yet on the ground when
he received a blow from Johnny&rsquo;s good right
hand that sent him hurtling into the dark. At
the same instant, as if by magic, the money
on the board vanished and the kerosene flare
that lighted the wheel went out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The next instant Johnny felt some one tugging
at his arm and heard a voice whisper
hoarsely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snap out of it, can&rsquo;t you? Want to spill
the works? C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recognizing the voice as one of authority,
Johnny obeyed.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of ducking and dodging found
him at last in his own tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat that?&rdquo; he exclaimed in a
whisper as he switched on the light and looked
down at his right hand. &ldquo;Got that money, all
of it. Now I&rsquo;ll have to find that truck farmer
and give it back. Gee! I hope I find him.
And I hope his five kids are cute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spread the bills out in a neat pile on his
knee. Then he made them into a compact roll
and thrust them deep into his pocket. But
this was not the end of that affair. It was
only the beginning.</p>
<p>He snapped off the light. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be too
careful,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>For a moment his head was in a whirl. Then
of a sudden he leaned forward in the posture
of one who listens intently. A faint sound
had come to his ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Footsteps,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Measured footsteps
as of a sentry on duty. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now a fresh sound greeted his ears.</p>
<p>The steady drum of a powerful airplane motor,
growing louder and ever louder until it
filled the very air, passed directly above his
head and then thundered on into the distance.</p>
<p>Once it had passed he forgot the plane. He
might well have given it much thought, for
the driver of that plane and its precious freight
were to enter much into his life. It was the
night Air Mail from New York. And on this
particular night it bore curious and priceless
freight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MYSTERIOUS SENTRY</span></h2>
<p>As the drone of the motor died away in the
distance, Johnny became conscious once
more of the sentry-like tread from without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can that be?&rdquo; His heart went into a
tailspin. He was alone, unarmed. He thought
of the gamblers, of Greasy Thumb and his
gang, and of the money in his pocket, that
roll of bills which belonged&mdash;well, to whom
did it belong?</p>
<p>Regaining control of his nerves, he crept
noiselessly to the front of the tent, then cautiously
opened the flap a narrow crack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The sight that met his eye caused him to
start back. Barely did he escape making an
audible exclamation of surprise and alarm.
There, walking slowly back and forth before
the tent, now in the shadows, now in a narrow
spot of light, was as strange a figure as one
might hope to see. Wrapped from head to
ankle in a long gray coat&mdash;or was it a robe?&mdash;wearing
gray shoes, gray gloves and with
a gray slouch hat pulled down over his eyes,
and with something that at least resembled a
gray beard hiding the lower part of his face,
this tall, slim man, if man it were, presented an
awe-inspiring spectacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gray Shadow!&rdquo; Johnny whispered
with a shudder. Twice before, each time in
the heart of the city, he had caught a fleeting
glimpse of this curious figure. Each time he
had been in grave danger. With the passing
of the Gray Shadow the danger, too, had
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it is here,&rdquo; he thought to himself.
As he stared, the Gray Shadow disappeared
into the depths of deeper, darker shadows and
did not return. At the same moment Johnny
thought he discerned figures retreating in the
opposite direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer doings!&rdquo; he muttered to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>A moment later a low whistle sounded at
the back of the tent. It was followed almost
at once by sounds of stealthy movements.
This time Johnny did not quail. He knew
that whistle. Two minutes had not passed
when two old friends, Drew Lane and Tom
Howe, came creeping in on hands and knees.
They had lifted the canvas at the back and
entered unannounced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see it?&rdquo; Johnny whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo; Drew Lane demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him or it? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gray Shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; Drew Lane&rsquo;s tone was filled with
doubt. He had never seen the Gray Shadow.
Being a detective, and a good one, he believed
only in that which he had seen with his own
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I saw him right enough this time!&rdquo;
Johnny declared. &ldquo;Walked across in front of
my tent twice before he disappeared; exactly
as if that were his business. Queerest sight
you ever could look at. Didn&rsquo;t seem human.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Drew Lane agreed, rather
sharply. &ldquo;You may have your shadows. We&rsquo;ll
deal with real crooks. That&rsquo;s a detective&rsquo;s
business. Greasy Thumb and his gang are
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cleared out, far&rsquo;s I can tell. Their booth
and the tent back of it are entirely deserted.
They&rsquo;ll not be back, is my guess. Off on some
big business. Pity is, we&rsquo;ve missed their trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In the meantime, the lone pilot of the sky
who had winged his way over Johnny&rsquo;s booth
an hour before was meeting with an unusual
adventure. Had Johnny Thompson known
who that pilot was he would have become excited
beyond words, for this was none other
than Curlie Carson. And Curlie Carson, as
you will know, if you have read <i>The Rope of
Gold</i>, had been Johnny&rsquo;s companion in many
wild adventures in that island of the Black
Republic: Haiti. At the conclusion of those
adventures they had parted. Now, with one
of the queer tricks she appears to delight in,
Fate had brought them within a very short
distance of one another. And this time each
was busy battling his way out from the tangle
of mystery that was being woven about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>After living in Haiti for a time, Curlie had
found himself once more in the grip of wanderlust.
Having returned to New York, he
fell in with a friend who was in the Air Mail
Service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with us,&rdquo; his friend had invited.
&ldquo;Know the thrill of service in the clouds. Join
a growing enterprise. Already Uncle Sam&rsquo;s
airplanes each day travel a distance equal to
the airline that reaches from Chicago to Cape
Town, Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie had joined up gladly. A natural mechanic,
and an aviator with several hundred
miles to his credit, he was not long in gaining
a place near the first rank of mail pilots.</p>
<p>When one of the regular Air Mail pilots
flying from New York had been laid up by a
case of nerves following a crackup, Curlie was
given the stick. So here he was on his third
long flight with fifteen hundred pounds of mail
on board, his powerful plane drumming happily
through the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Happily, but not for long. Scarcely had he
passed over the bright lights that shone up
from the &ldquo;Greatest of all Carnivals,&rdquo; than
things began to happen.</p>
<p>The beginning seemed insignificant enough.
His keen ears had detected a sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that sound?&rdquo; He had strained
his ears in a vain endeavor to distinguish this
new beat on his eardrums which had come to
disturb him.</p>
<p>Not that there had been no sound before.
There was plenty. For hours he had listened
to the ceaseless roar of a six hundred horsepower
airplane motor. True, this was muffled
by a heavy radio head-set pressed lightly
against his ears. But it was distinct enough
for all that.</p>
<p>And now there had come a second sound.
At first faint, indistinct. Then louder. Like
bells, motors have their one definite sound and
pitch. The experienced airman knows the
sound of his own motor and many others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a plane,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;But at such
a time, and such a place!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Allowing one hand to rest gently on his control
stick, he half rose in the cockpit to peer
blindly into the void of darkness, of moonless
night, that lay all about him.</p>
<p>For a full moment he remained standing
thus, motionless, while his eyes swept in a
circle, up, down and sideways, many times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No lights,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I take my oath
to that. Dangerous business I&rsquo;d say. Suppose
they&rsquo;d miss the sound of my motor, the
gleam of my lights!&rdquo; He shuddered at thought
of a head-on collision, of broken wings, flaming
planes and sudden death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breaking the law, that&rsquo;s what they are!
Wish I had their number. I&rsquo;d report them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he but known it, the occupants of this
plane were infractors of the law in more ways
than one. Not knowing, he settled back in his
seat, gripped his stick firmly and gave his
mind over to the important business of bringing
the Air Mail from New York.</p>
<p>The drumming of the mysterious plane did
not leave his ears undisturbed, nor did troubling
thoughts pass from his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Up to something,&rdquo; he told himself. He
thought of one precious bit of cargo that lay
so near him he might touch it with his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty thousand dollars,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem that it could be worth that. But
that&rsquo;s what he said. And he&rsquo;s always told the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snap on the radio,&rdquo; he murmured after a
moment. &ldquo;May get some clue from that.&rdquo; His
plane was equipped with a receiving set by
which weather reports and special orders
reached him.</p>
<p>He was destined to receive a clue regarding
the mystery plane, and that very soon. And
such a clue! It would set his blood racing and
his hands trembling.</p>
<p>But for the moment all was as it had been.
Nothing came in over the air. His plane behaved
beautifully. True, at times she bumped
a bit as he speeded her up, but that was to be
expected.</p>
<p>Half forgetting the other plane, he settled
back in his seat to think of the hours that had
just passed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>It had been George Wiseman, the mail clerk
at the New York office, who had shown Curlie
three unusual packages which went with
hundreds of others to make up his fifteen hundred
pounds of cargo.</p>
<p>Had Curlie been the usual type of air pilot
he would have known nothing of those packages.
He was far from the usual type. Instead
of loafing about the hangar swapping
stories with other pilots, he was uptown in
New York, learning things.</p>
<p>His work and his mail interested him most.
He was eager to know all about it from beginning
to end.</p>
<p>George Wiseman had grown old in the mail
service. He was tall, gray and stooped. His
gray eyes were keen. He knew much and was
willing to help the eager young pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys of the Air Mail know little
enough about the service you perform,&rdquo; he had
said to Curlie as he busied himself with the
tasks of making up the mail. &ldquo;You see the
mail in sacks. It&rsquo;s packed away in the fusilage,
and you go thundering away. At the other
end it is dragged out, piled into a truck, and
is away again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;We at this end&mdash;&rdquo; He reached for one of
the registered mail pouches. &ldquo;We know a little
more, sometimes a great deal more. People
confide in us. They tell us of their desires,
their hopes, their fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take these three packages.&rdquo; He jerked a
thumb at a small, a medium sized and a rather
large package. &ldquo;To me they represent three
things: a great necessity, an emergency and a
mystery. To you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about them!&rdquo; Curlie had exclaimed
quickly. &ldquo;It will make the trip more
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will that!&rdquo; exclaimed the aged mail
clerk. &ldquo;Even thrilling, you might say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little one,&rdquo; he went on, after ten seconds
of silence, &ldquo;is medicine, some sort of antitoxin,
I think the man said. It&rsquo;s for a very
sick child, a beautiful little girl, five years old,
a college professor&rsquo;s daughter. She might die
if you failed to go through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there now!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Perhaps
I&rsquo;ve told you too much. It may bother you,
make you unsteady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Curlie with assurance. &ldquo;My
mind doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Been tried before.
Added responsibility steadies me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to be. It&rsquo;s the sign of a
healthy mind in a healthy body. These boys
that smoke a cigaret every four minutes, now.
They&rsquo;re not like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me about that one.&rdquo; Curlie pointed
to the largest of the three packages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worth forty thousand dollars.&rdquo; The gray
old clerk slid the package into the sack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty thous&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the man said. Don&rsquo;t doubt it. See
who it&rsquo;s for? Fritz Lieber. You know who
that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest living violinist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many say so. And this is his violin, one
of them, perhaps his best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why here?&rdquo; Curlie stared in astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has another. He likes the other as well;
has it on tour. To-morrow in your city he is
to play for fifteen hundred crippled children.
That&rsquo;s for the afternoon. At night he plays for
the rich, the beautiful, the mighty, in the opera
house. Thirty-five hundred of them. And
his violin, his precious instrument, is out of
commission. Don&rsquo;t know why nor how.
Somebody careless, probably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; he added, placing a hand lightly
on the package, &ldquo;is his chance, the only other
he can use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His and the crippled children&rsquo;s chance.&rdquo;
Curlie&rsquo;s tone was almost reverent. &ldquo;They
shall have the chance. We&rsquo;ll go through, my
plane and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie recalled these words now as he
ploughed on through the darkness and the
night. Still there came to his ears the mysterious
drumming of that other plane.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, so loud that the speaker
seemed at his very elbow, words broke in upon
the thunder of the motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The radio!&rdquo; he whispered tensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Official orders!&rdquo; came in a gruff voice.
&ldquo;Land at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Land at once! in this darkness!&rdquo; the boy
thought in dismay. He was over a level farm
country. The thing was possible. But why?</p>
<p>Emergencies, the child&rsquo;s medicine, the violin,
all called for full speed ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land!&rdquo; he cried aloud to the waiting night.
&ldquo;Land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply vouchsafed him. His
machine carried no sending set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land!&rdquo; he muttered suddenly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
plot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He touched a lever. His motor thundered
louder than ever and his thoughts raced with
the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he told himself a moment later,
&ldquo;was a mistake. It told them at once that I
accept their challenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what did they want? Again his
thoughts flew to the sack of registered mail
in the fusilage just before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three precious packages,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be the medicine. Who would rob a
dying child?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;The violin! Forty thousand dollars! that&rsquo;s
it. They would rob the mail to get that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, as he gave the matter a second
thought, the thing seemed uncertain. There
was no doubting the true value of the violin.
But where would a robber sell it? Such instruments
are few; they are known the world over.
To offer a stolen one for sale would be to court
arrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the third package,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;Mr. Wiseman said this one contained a mystery.
&lsquo;A strange, wild-eyed man in shabby attire
brought it to the office. He placed a twenty
dollar gold piece on the counter, paid the
highest possible insurance fee upon the package,
which is heavily sealed with wax, and
then without a word he walked away.&rsquo; Those
were Mr. Wiseman&rsquo;s very words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now the time for reflection was past.
The time for action had come. The voice was
once more in his ear. Gruffer than before, it
set aside all pretense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come down, or we&rsquo;ll bring you down
like a crippled wild goose!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Curlie shuddered. What was this, a plain
robbery, or did that mysterious package contain
some terrible secret?</p>
<p>He was alone in the dark. The hour neared
midnight. He was high in the air. What
could he do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mail bag is within my reach. I could
swing out with it and jump. Parachute would
save the treasure and me,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>But would it? The parachute was large and
white. Even in the night it might be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;d land and catch me. I&rsquo;d crash
my plane for nothing, and all that mail would
probably be burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crash the plane! No. He couldn&rsquo;t do that.
That old plane meant much to him. In it he
had outridden many a wild storm.</p>
<p>Then, too, there was the Air Mail pilots&rsquo;
slogan: &ldquo;The mail must go through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it shall!&rdquo; he shouted into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come down!&rdquo; the voice from the air
insisted.</p>
<p>In his desperation the boy lifted his eyes to
the skies in silent prayer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Did the answer come at once? Be that as
it may, a thought flashed into his mind.</p>
<p>In the fusilage directly behind him was a
twelve foot parachute. Fastened to the parachute
was, of all things, a large doll and a new
doll buggy.</p>
<p>On the route, a few miles beyond a small
city, was a farm. Curlie had made a forced
landing there the trip before this one. There
he had made the acquaintance of a child, a
happy, most cheerful little girl, and yet a terrible
cripple.</p>
<p>Curlie read his Bible. He believed what he
read. Some day, if he fed the poor, visited the
sick and was kind to crippled children, he
would hear the great Master say, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had written a letter to the crippled child,
had received an answer and had learned that
she wanted a doll and a doll carriage. This
day he had meant to send the gifts down by
a red parachute. The clouds had hid the little
farm. The parachute was still behind him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I remove the doll and attach the registered
sack to the parachute I can toss it over
and they won&rsquo;t see it. Red shows black at
night. They&rsquo;d never find it. Then I can land
and take what comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have two minutes to land!&rdquo; The voice
was more threatening than ever.</p>
<p>Two minutes! The hum of the other motor
grew louder. The radio was not on that plane,
but on some building not so far away.</p>
<p>Two minutes! He worked feverishly. The
cord stuck. He cut it, then tied it again. He
dragged out the bag. He lifted the parachute
free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The violin!&rdquo; His heart sank. Yet the parachute
would lower the sack gently to the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only chance.&rdquo; With one wide, clear
swing, he tossed the sack over.</p>
<p>The next instant his plane tilted downward.
Not a moment too soon, for a motor thundering
by passed again into the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meant to shoot me down,&rdquo; he muttered
breathlessly.</p>
<p>He reached for a switch, pulled it, and at
once saw a finger of light from his powerful
landing lamp pointing earthward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>For a space of ten seconds he studied the
surface of the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Level pasture. Take a chance. Land in the
dark. Might escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was darkness. And now, too,
came silence. He had shut off his motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re landing, too,&rdquo; he thought with a
thrill and a shudder. &ldquo;I wonder where?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A COLD SCENT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, they&rsquo;re gone all right. Cleared
out.&rdquo; Drew Lane spoke in tones
scarcely above a whisper. &ldquo;Of course they
may be just outside, for all we know.&rdquo; His
hand involuntarily strayed to his hip.</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson, Drew Lane and Tom
Howe were still in Johnny&rsquo;s tent. The adventures
that were befalling Curlie Carson, for
the moment, meant nothing to them. They
were beyond earshot of it all. All unconscious
of it, they were discussing their own affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; Tom Howe, who seldom
spoke, but whose actions spoke for him, broke
the silence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my notion they have gone
out for the big thing, whatever that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big thing?&rdquo; Johnny leaned forward
eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Drew Lane broke in. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
think such fellows as Greasy Thumb and his
mob would come out here to run a tin horn
gambler&rsquo;s game, do you? Say! They&rsquo;re supposed
to be right next to the Big Shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Big Shot! Johnny was impressed.
Who had not heard of the Big Shot, the man
who headed the greatest beer running, gambling
house operating gang of robbers the land
has ever known?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom Howe. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re after
something big. But what it could be in a quiet
little city like this is more than I can guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps you have wondered how it came
about that Drew Lane and Tom Howe, the
successful young detectives of a great city&rsquo;s
force, were to be found in a small carnival city
fifty miles from the bright lights of the greatest
boulevard.</p>
<p>The truth is, a city&rsquo;s detective force does
not confine its activities to the city&rsquo;s limits.
The crooks that make a city their home belong
to that city. If they choose to leave it
for a time, certain of the city&rsquo;s hounds of justice
are likely to camp on their trails.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Summer is the time for the migration of
evil doers. They thrive on crowds. In a crowd
a purse may be snatched, a hold-up perpetrated,
even murder done, and the criminal
may at once lose himself in that crowd.</p>
<p>In winter crowds are found only in cities.
Summer sees country parks, carnivals and fairgrounds
thronged with people. The crooks
prey upon these crowds just as the pike does
on a school of perch.</p>
<p>Some city police officers are content to spend
their lives patrolling a beat. They have their
place and contribute their bit to the city&rsquo;s happiness
and safety. Others ride about in squad
cars listening for trouble. Still others, like
Drew Lane and Tom Howe, restless souls, are
by nature free lances. They know hundreds
of evil doers by sight and are ever clinging
doggedly to their heels.</p>
<p>It was even so now. Having become aware
of the exit of a dangerous gang of professional
criminals from the city, they had followed.
And here they were.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>If you have read that other book, <i>The Arrow of Fire</i>,
I need not tell you that Drew
Lane, not many months out of college, impersonated
a natty college youth, and Tom Howe,
slight, stooped, and freckled, had prepared
himself to play the role of a country boy come
to the &ldquo;Greatest of All Carnivals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now here they were gathered in Johnny&rsquo;s
tent, for a time completely off the trail
of Greasy Thumb and his gang, awaiting the
break of &ldquo;something big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as they waited, not ten miles away
Johnny&rsquo;s old pal, Curlie Carson, was preparing
to land his plane in an unknown field at
night, forced down by a voice in the air, and
with the mail sack containing three precious
packages sinking to earth somewhere in the
void of darkness behind him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A MOMENTOUS DECISION</span></h2>
<p>In choosing to land in the dark on an unknown
field, Curlie Carson realized that he
was taking a terrible chance. Night landings
are always a problem. The appearance of the
ground is deceiving. A narrow run, deep and
dangerous, may be hidden by its banks; a sudden
swell may bring disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a life lost. But there are times
when one must take chances,&rdquo; he told himself
stoutly. He was thinking of the medicine in
that sack back there somewhere in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those villains doing all this for gain,
or what?&rdquo; He thought now of those mysterious
ones who were hounding him. &ldquo;They
can&rsquo;t know how terrible it all is. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a sudden bump; another; another;
many bumps in quick succession. He
was landing. Setting his brakes hard, he unsnapped
his harness and prepared to leap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>With a suddenness that was startling, the
plane came to a stop. It appeared to strain
forward; then it recoiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit a fence,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Good thing
it wasn&rsquo;t sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was over the side and away. Plunging
forward, he paused to grope for the fence.
Having found it, he went skulking along it
from post to post.</p>
<p>His reasons for this were two. If a light
shot in his direction the fence would offer
some chance of concealment. He could become
a stone in the fence row. Then, too, the
fence gave him direction. He had been flying
due west. This fence ran north and south.
It would be crossed by another. When he
found this he would turn east. About a mile
and a half back was the precious mail sack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find it,&rdquo; he assured himself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
too late yet. Only sixty miles more to go.
Some one will take me to a station or an airdrome.
Please God, the medicine will reach
its destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the violin,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Fifteen hundred
crippled children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to listen. Some one was shouting.
They had found his plane, discovered that he
was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will they do now?&rdquo; He raced on.</p>
<p>He was to know soon enough. From somewhere
in that expanse of pasture a pencil of
light began circling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a searchlight from their plane. I&rsquo;m
lost, perhaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no. Perhaps not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one eye on the light, he moved slowly
forward. When at last it sought his fence
row and followed it, there was nothing moving
there. The light did not pause as it passed
across a log or a stone in the fence row. It
moved to its limit in that direction and then
began searching other corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t suspect that the bag is back
yonder,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Think I have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time, ready at any moment to play
&rsquo;possum, he crept forward. Coming to an intersection
of fences, he turned east.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>At last he sprang to his feet and ran again.</p>
<p>Quite out of breath, and beyond the range
of the light, he slowed down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mile and a half,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Covered
half of it already. Have to use my flashlight
to find the bag. More danger. They may see
it. Oh, well, my legs are as good as theirs.
But guns!&rdquo; He shuddered.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes of brisk walking and he
judged himself to be near the place where the
parachute had dropped.</p>
<p>Turning his back to the fence he prepared
to walk straight forward for some distance.
He had not taken a dozen steps when his foot
caught on something and he barely escaped a
fall.</p>
<p>Putting out a hand, he let forth an involuntary
exclamation. He had tripped on the red
parachute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great luck!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>The next moment found the precious bag
and the parachute (which he vowed should
still bring a doll to his little friend) tucked
under his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to reflect. This was a pasture.
Every pasture, if it does not touch the farm
yard on one corner, has a lane leading to the
farm buildings. If he continued to follow the
fence he might come to the farmer&rsquo;s house.
So he reasoned.</p>
<p>And he was right. Fifteen minutes had not
passed before the farmer, aroused by the loud
barking of his dog, was standing in his door,
demanding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Air Mail flyer,&rdquo; Curlie replied, in as
even a tone as he could command. &ldquo;Plane&rsquo;s
down in your pasture. I need your help. The
mail must go through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down, there!&rdquo; the man growled at his dog.
&ldquo;What do you want,&rdquo; he asked Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a car?&rdquo; Curlie asked, stepping
to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a truck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it to town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Aurora, eight miles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aurora!&rdquo; Curlie&rsquo;s hopes rose. At Aurora
there was an airport. If this farmer but knew
the way to the airport, the precious parcel of
mail would not be long delayed.</p>
<p>He felt for the sack. The three packages,
undamaged by the fall, were still there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to Aurora at once,&rdquo; he said in a
tone that carried authority. &ldquo;You will be well
paid. But besides this, it is your duty. Every
man, in time of emergency, is the servant of
his country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is true,&rdquo; the man agreed, as he
drew on his coat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the car; then
we&rsquo;ll go for the mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So little!&rdquo; The man stared with unbelieving
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is much more. This is all that matters
now. This is urgent. It&rsquo;s a registered
sack. Perhaps a matter of life and death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as Curlie spoke he caught the sound of
voices. They came from the direction of the
plane. His pursuers were approaching the
farmhouse, having discovered that the registered
mail was gone. Would he yet be caught?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We must go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer, too, had heard the shouts. He
appeared bewildered, undecided.</p>
<p>Without wasting another word, the boy
whipped out his flashlight, set it circling the
barnyard, then dashed to a shed where the
truck was kept. The next instant the motor
was purring.</p>
<p>Before the farmer had collected his wits
sufficiently to move, Curlie had driven the
truck into the center of the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he thinks I am a mail robber,
those others the pilots,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;What can a farmer know about such things?
If worse comes to worst, I&rsquo;ll drive away alone
and take the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proved unnecessary. Awakened from
his sleep to find himself confronted by an
emergency, the slow-going, methodical farmer
had found his mind unequal to the situation.
When his own truck came rumbling up to his
doorstep he climbed in; then, at the boy airman&rsquo;s
request, he pointed the way to the small
city nearest his home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>For a time at least after that, fortune favored
Curlie. The road to town, he found, led
by the airport. Half an hour had not elapsed
before the shuddering farm truck drew up at
the airport&rsquo;s entrance.</p>
<p>Hastily handing the farmer a banknote, he
began pounding at the door of a room where
a dim light shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want?&rdquo; grumbled a voice, as the
door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plane to Chicago. Special Air Mail. An
emergency. Plane down in a pasture five
miles back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man glanced at the mail sack, at
Curlie&rsquo;s uniform, then said cheerily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto! Warm one up at once. Good bus.
Want the stick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better come. Take her back. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later a powerful motor began a
low rumble. The rumble increased to a roar,
then died down again. Three times this was
repeated. Then Curlie climbed aboard a two-seater.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time for three winks,&rdquo; he thought, as he
strapped himself in.</p>
<p>Long hours had passed since he had left his
last airport. Excitement and mental struggle
had tired him. Accustomed as he was to being
aloft, he fell asleep at once and remained
so until the bump-bump of his plane, landing
on the city field, awoke him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re there!&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;The
city at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his task was only begun. Ordinarily
he would have delivered his mail to a truck
driver. The driver would carry it to the post
office and his responsibility would end. But
to-night he was late. An emergency existed.
Knowing the great need, he was obliged to
decide whether or not to take matters in his
own hands. Should he rip open the locked
sack and deliver the three parcels in person?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>In such a course he realized there would be
a grave element of risk. Tampering with the
mail is serious business. Should one package
escape from his hands before it was delivered,
he would be held responsible. The loss of one
precious package would mean a loss to his
company. The company alone was responsible
for the mail until it was received by the
postal authorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A slip would mean loss of position&mdash;disgrace,&rdquo;
he told himself.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch. It was well past
midnight. &ldquo;The last post office messenger boy
leaves at 11 o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Had the
emergency existed in the beginning I might
have phoned in and had a mail clerk stay until
I arrived. Now there is only one chance.
I must take matters in my own hands or wait
for the office to open in the morning. And
that may be too late.&rdquo; For a moment he hesitated.</p>
<p>He was tired. The way had been long. His
comfortable bed awaited him. It would be so
easy to report the whole affair, send planes
and pilots for his abandoned mail plane, and
then turn over the special sack to the office and
go home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow isn&rsquo;t responsible for that which
he is not supposed to know,&rdquo; he told himself
stoutly. &ldquo;Mr. Wiseman had no real right to
tell me about those packages. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now rose the picture of a child tossing
in pain, of a father pacing the floor waiting
for medicine that did not come. Then a second
picture came to haunt him: hundreds of
eager-eyed crippled children waiting in vain
for the celestial notes of a marvelous violin
played by a master&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law of the need of those who suffer is
higher than any other law,&rdquo; he told himself
stoutly. &ldquo;I will take the risk. I will deliver
them in person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later, after having reported
the astonishing affair to the night director of
the airport, he plunged into the darkness that
is a great city&rsquo;s outer borders at night, with
the precious sack still under his arm. Written
on the tablets of his mind was the address of
the home where the sick girl lay.</p>
<p>Boarding a street car, he rode eight blocks.
Having overhauled a night prowling taxi, he
leaped into it from the car and went speeding
away into the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>As he settled back for an eight mile ride,
there crept into his mind again grave misgivings.
The sack at his side had been cut open
by his own hand, and this the most precious,
the most carefully guarded of all mail. Not
one package might pass from one hand to another
without an official signature and a
stamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I dared break all rules!&rdquo; he told himself,
as his heart stood still. &ldquo;One slip now,
and I am done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done! Out of the mail service forever.
Out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How he loved his work! Climbing into the
clouds in the dewy morning; racing the stars
at night; the air; the sky; all the freedom of
a bird. How could he stand losing all this?</p>
<p>And yet, even from these he passed to more
disturbing thoughts. Was that gang still after
him? Where were they now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;They, too, may be in the city by now,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;What if they overhaul me before
my task is done?&rdquo; He shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must not!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Driver!&rdquo; He leaned forward. &ldquo;Driver, all
the speed you dare. And an extra fee for your
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a fresh burst of power the taxi sped
on through the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MARKED MONEY</span></h2>
<p>There was little sleeping that night in
Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s tent at the back of
his booth, at the &ldquo;Greatest of all Carnivals.&rdquo;
True, Johnny remained in the tent to doze off
at times. Drew Lane and his partner spent
their time in scouting about searching for
clues that might lead them to the whereabouts
of Greasy Thumb and his gang.</p>
<p>Once, while Johnny was alone, he drew the
roll of bills from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to do with these?&rdquo; he asked
himself. &ldquo;Give them to that truck farmer?
Simple enough. But where is he? Where does
he live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He examined the bills closely, then let out
a low whistle. Two of them were marked with
a faint red cross in the corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Marked money!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a low
tone. &ldquo;Bad business! Dangerous! Like to
throw them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, because this roll represented a fairly
large sum of money, he did not obey that impulse.
Instead, he thrust them once more into
his pocket.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, having returned from
one more fruitless search, Drew and Tom were
about to join Johnny in a steaming cup of coffee
when, without ceremony, a curious individual
crept into the tent.</p>
<p>At sight of him Johnny started back. A
very small man, with a long sharp nose and
piercing yellow eyes, he might have been said
to crawl rather than walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Drew assured Johnny.
&ldquo;Meet the Ferret. He is one of us. Very much
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Ferret,&rdquo; he greeted the newcomer.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man did not reply at once. Instead, he
put out a hand for a cup of the scalding coffee,
placed it to his lips and drained it without a
pause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hot stuff!&rdquo; muttered Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very hot!&rdquo; agreed Drew.</p>
<p>The dog has been named man&rsquo;s best friend.
Yet as a hunter he has his handicaps. True,
he is a swift runner and can make a great
noise. Often by sheer bluff he drives the
coyote from the hen roost. Then, too, he can
dig. At times he drags a rat from his den and
destroys him.</p>
<p>The cat has his good points also. He is sly,
patient. For hours he waits beside some enemy&rsquo;s
trail until the great moment comes.
Then one swift spring, a cry of surprise and
pain, and all is over.</p>
<p>Yet dog and cat alike are powerless before
the sly, deep-digging weasel, the mink and
the skunk. Only one crafty, half tamed pet
of mankind can cope with these. The ferret
with his slim, snake-like body, his beady eyes,
his prying nose, glides noiselessly into the
deepest burrows and sends its denizens rushing
from their dark haunts into sunshine and
death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>So, too, in the ranks of mankind the ferret
is to be found. Lacking in physical strength
and prowess, yet endowed with a faculty for
discovering hidden dens, the human ferret is
ever closely associated with the police. He
wears neither badge nor uniform. His name
is not on the pay roll. Despised by some, he
is feared by many. For it is he who many
times brings the evil doer to justice.</p>
<p>The strange person who crept into Johnny&rsquo;s
tent was of this sort. Indeed, so definitely had
his vocation been chosen for him by nature
that he was known only as &ldquo;The Ferret.&rdquo; If
he had any other name it had been forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; had one great redeeming quality.
He was a sincere friend of justice. He
furnished information only to those who made
an honest attempt to enforce the law. He was
possessed of an uncanny power. He appeared
to read men&rsquo;s minds. Was an officer a traitor
to the cause he had sworn to serve? &ldquo;The
Ferret&rdquo; knew it on the instant. No information
was forthcoming to such a one. Indeed,
if he did not watch his step he was likely to
feel &ldquo;The Ferret&rsquo;s&rdquo; bite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The source of his income was not known.
Some rumors had it that a rich philanthropist,
realizing his value to the community, had endowed
him for life. Another was that he was
rich in his own name, that he owned a flat
building, stocks, bonds and mortgages, and
that his occupation was but a hobby. Strange
hobby, you will say; yet there have been
stranger, and far less useful.</p>
<p>Because they were honest, sincere and fearless,
Drew and Howe were ever in &ldquo;The Ferret&rsquo;s&rdquo;
favor.</p>
<p>Drew Lane&rsquo;s eyes were alight as they fell
upon the insignificant form of &ldquo;The Ferret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he demanded once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mailplane brought down and robbed ten
miles from here.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ferret&rsquo;s&rdquo; voice was
low and soft.</p>
<p>How could &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; know this so
quickly? Who can say? The source of his
information must have been of an obscure nature.
For when Drew pressed him for details
he could furnish none. Nor could he tell
whether Greasy Thumb had a hand in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s so valuable in the Air Mail?&rdquo;
Johnny asked. &ldquo;I thought that was for the
most part personal messages, important to the
sender, but worthless to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the most part, yes,&rdquo; Drew agreed. &ldquo;But
think of the emergencies the Air Mail is prepared
to meet. A big deal in stocks is on. The
actual securities must be delivered within
twenty-four hours. The Air Mail brings them.
Mrs. Jones-Smith-Walker, the millionaire widow,
arrives in Chicago only to find that a great
reception has been planned for her at the country
home of her bosom friends, Mrs. Burns-Walker.
Her jewels, a hundred thousand dollars&rsquo;
worth or more, are in New York. Without
them she will not be properly dressed.
The Air Mail brings them. And who knows
but that, through some secret channels the
powerful, sometimes rich, sometimes poor,
gang that is forever preying upon the foolish
rich society folks are tipped off in advance regarding
the consignment. Worth going after.
What? If you don&rsquo;t care for the law and
have little fear of prison.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say this is the
case. I have no information which would even
lead me to suspect such a thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one fact stands out clearly!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
springing into action. &ldquo;The trail
leads to the city. Big affairs may be pulled off
by crooks in the country at times. But they
always speed away to the city afterward. For
it is there that they may most effectually lose
themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come. Let&rsquo;s be moving. We will find
Greasy Thumb in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we will,&rdquo; Johnny murmured to
himself, as he began a hasty pack-up of his
personal effects preparatory to leaving his
spindle wheel and many baskets of groceries
to anyone who chose to take them over on the
morrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;The city,&rdquo; he murmured after a time, &ldquo;the
strangest, weirdest, most fascinating, most
beautiful, most dangerous place man has ever
known. In the jungle the tiger slinks away
from man. There you may sleep in peace. On
the polar waste the great white bear floats by
on his palace of ice. He will not molest you.
In the Rockies where the grizzly roams and
the mountain lion inhabits the treetops you
are safe. But the city? Oh, well, perhaps you
are safe enough there. Who knows?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he whispered back as he left
his booth, &ldquo;good-bye, old carnival. Good-bye,
big-noise-about-nothing. Good-bye, screaming
women. Good-bye, laughing children.
We&rsquo;re here to-day and away to-morrow.&rdquo; He
choked a little over these last words. This
strange life, the carnival spirit, had got under
his skin. Gladly he would have remained.
But duty called. &ldquo;Good-bye, good-bye. We&rsquo;re
here to-day and away to-morrow. The city
beckons. We must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Settled on the cushions on the back seat of
a high-powered police car driven by Drew
Lane, Johnny Thompson had time for a few
sober reflections.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>As you know from reading <i>The Arrow of
Fire</i>, Johnny&rsquo;s latest venture was in the field
of police detection. Many tales Johnny had
read of shrewd private detectives who outwitted
clever criminals and showed up the stupidity
of the police. Johnny had found it difficult
to believe that all police detectives were
stupid. By contact with four men, Herman
McCarthey, Newton Mills, Drew Lane and
Tom Howe, he had come to know that men
with keen minds and sturdy bodies were more
and more offering their services to the police
departments of their cities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No better detective ever lived than Drew
Lane,&rdquo; a reporter had once said to Johnny.
And Johnny had found this to be true. He
gave himself over with genuine abandon to
the business of being Drew Lane&rsquo;s understudy.</p>
<p>Yet, at this moment he found himself missing
certain friends who had added joy and inspiration
to his life. In a great city friends
come and go quickly. Herman McCarthey
had retired from active service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Newton Mills,&rdquo; he grumbled to himself.
&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where indeed? Johnny had once lifted this
shadow of a great detective out from a living
hell of remorse and drink and had set him
doing marvelous things for the law again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;But now he is gone,&rdquo; he mourned. &ldquo;I wonder
if drink has claimed him. Or is he dead?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly dead,&rdquo; he corrected himself. &ldquo;Men,
like wounded fish, come to the surface to die.
Had he died I would have known it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at this moment he
thought once more of that spectre-like individual,
the Gray Shadow, that had three times
crossed his path and three times vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unusual sort of person, if it be a person,&rdquo;
he said to himself. &ldquo;Always appears when I
am in more or less danger. If I believed in the
return of the spirits of the dead I&rsquo;d say it was
the spirit of some dead friend set to guard
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Joyce Mills, that daring daughter of a
famous father, you will recall her. Johnny,
too, recalled her with a sigh.</p>
<p>Some people he found it difficult to understand.
Joyce Mills was one of these. Once
she had inspired him. Now she had gone into
the humdrum business of selling books in a
department store.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;At least that&rsquo;s what she was doing when I
saw her last. Queer business for a girl like
that,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>
<p>And yet, as he recollected his last meeting
with her, he seemed again to detect a mysterious
twinkle in her eyes which appeared to say:
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know all; nor even half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd sort of girl,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Have
to look her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here we are nearing the city and a new
day.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>&ldquo;Turn, turn my wheel,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>All things must change</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>To something new,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>To something strange.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>The wind blows east,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>The wind blows west,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>The blue eggs in the robin&rsquo;s nest</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Will soon have wings</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And beaks and breasts,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And flutter and fly away;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>To-morrow be to-day.&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>So much for the thoughts of Johnny Thompson.
He expressed himself in verse at times.
Not so, Drew Lane. His thoughts were of a
grim and practical sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; he said, speaking to his companion
and pal, &ldquo;Tom, old boy, if we see Greasy
Thumb and his pardner, Three Fingers Barbinelle,
we&rsquo;ll arrest them on sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And arrange a case against them later,&rdquo;
agreed Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold them on a vagrancy charge. Or more
than likely we&rsquo;ll find them carrying guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost sure to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Johnny broke in, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need to be
quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; replied Drew with a drawl, &ldquo;In this
sort of work there are but two classes of people,
&lsquo;the quick and the dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MYSTERIOUS PACKAGE</span></h2>
<p>What things may happen to him who
travels the dark streets of a great city
at night! What terrors lurk in corners that
lie inky black beyond the reach of some feeble
light. What unexpected hidden evil lies ever
just before him. And yet, how many countless
thousands have traveled these streets in
peace and safety, with not one finger lifted to
do them harm!</p>
<p>It happened thus to Curlie Carson. With
the precious mail sack tucked securely beneath
one elbow, he rode into the night while the
taximeter ticked off the miles. The driver he
had chanced upon was skillful and safe. He
knew his city well. The street address was
all he needed. In due course of time he brought
the cab to a jolting stop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The fee was soon paid, and Curlie found
himself passing down a winding walk bordered
on either side by a low hedge which led
to a quiet looking gray brick house.</p>
<p>A light was burning in the front window on
the second floor. His hand trembled as he
pressed the door bell. He had risked so much.
He had broken the laws of the postal service,
laws that until now had been all but sacred to
him. What if, after all, he were too late?
What if that light were but a death watch?</p>
<p>Footsteps sounded. A light, hanging in a
brass lantern above him, suddenly shone down
upon him.</p>
<p>The door opened. A middle-aged man in a
gray dressing robe stood before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is the Professor here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Professor.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s tone was
kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am from the Air Mail service. There was
medicine. I have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The medicine! Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; thought Johnny, &ldquo;it is not too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; He thrust a hand into the mail
bag, to secure the smallest package.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have it.&rdquo; The man grasped it
eagerly, then sprang away up the stairs, leaving
the astonished boy to stand and stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he thought after a time, &ldquo;guess
that&rsquo;s about all of that.&rdquo; He turned, about to
go, when a thought struck him.</p>
<p>He had no receipt for the package. What
proof had he that it had been delivered at all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in deep
enough now. Got to have a receipt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had turned about and stood undecided
whether to ring the bell at once or wait, when
suddenly a woman with a very beautiful face
appeared before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought the medicine. It will save
her. The doctor says it will be all right now.
How can we thank you!&rdquo; She all but embraced
him.</p>
<p>Curlie took a backward step. He swallowed
hard twice. Then he spoke. &ldquo;You&mdash;you
might just sign a receipt saying you received
the package.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Where is the form?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t any. You see,&rdquo; he half apologized,
&ldquo;I was forced to land in a pasture. I
knew about the medicine. I got through&mdash;don&rsquo;t
matter how. Then I&mdash;I cut the sack so
I could deliver the medicine. You see I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you broke the law to save our
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you might say&mdash;. Anyway, I know
it&rsquo;ll be all right. If one obeys his conscience
he doesn&rsquo;t get into much trouble, does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. But all the same that was
quite wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She invited him into a room whose walls
were lined with books. She left him there
while she went for the wrapper that showed
the registry number. When she had returned
she penned a receipt and handed it to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be hungry and tired,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you stay and rest? We will have some
hot coffee for you at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; the boy smiled his
thanks, &ldquo;there are two other packages. One
should be delivered without delay. It&rsquo;s a
priceless violin. Fritz Lieber&rsquo;s own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fritz Lieber!&rdquo; There was awe in her tone.
&ldquo;You must not go in a taxi. Our car is out.
The driver has been ready to go for the medicine,
if it were necessary. He shall take you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Curlie as he seemed to feel the
cozy comfort of a private car, &ldquo;will be grand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It only partly pays. If ever you are in
trouble, and need a friend, please do not forget
us.&rdquo; She pressed his hand hard as she
left him at the door.</p>
<p>Once more the impromptu messenger boy
raced into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever need a friend, don&rsquo;t forget us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words came to him again and again.
It was as if they had just been spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;Will
I be badly in need of a friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely if anything went wrong before the
remaining packages were delivered he would.
He had broken postal regulations, smashed
them all to bits.</p>
<p>But here he was again. The car had drawn
up before a hotel of magnificent proportions.
Even at these last hours of night, a liveried
attendant opened the car door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fri&mdash;Fritz Lieber,&rdquo; said Curlie in some confusion.
&ldquo;I must see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doorman stared at him and his torn
mailsack, but led the way to the desk.</p>
<p>Here the boy repeated his request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very unusual for a guest, especially so
important a guest, to be disturbed at this
hour,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;What is it, a registered
package? You may leave it. We&rsquo;ll deliver it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a registered package.&rdquo; Curlie spoke
slowly as he sized up the clerk and decided
not to confide in him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave it. I must
have Mr. Lieber&rsquo;s own signature. And I want
you to know that it is important. Mr. Lieber
will thank you for letting him know I am
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure about that,&rdquo; grumbled the
clerk. Nevertheless, he took down the receiver
and called a number.</p>
<p>He waited a moment, spoke a few words in
a low tone, then turning to Curlie said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lieber wishes to know whether or not
it is a violin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>A few more words, a surprised look on the
clerk&rsquo;s face, then a curt,</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see you. Room 1080. Elevator&rsquo;s over
there.&rdquo; A jerk of the clerk&rsquo;s thumb and Curlie
was once more on his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; the boy thought as the
elevator ascended. &ldquo;Soon be free from the responsibility
of carrying about a priceless violin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this other package?&rdquo; There was a
question. What was he to do with it, try to
deliver it in person, or turn it over to the postal
authorities? He knew little about that
package. Some wild-eyed man in shabby
clothes had paid the largest possible fee to insure
its safe delivery. The address was on the
first floor of a building in a doubtful section of
the city. That was all he knew. Little
enough, yet he was destined in time to know
enough about it to realize that had it been
filled with high explosive it could have been
scarcely less troublesome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>He was now at the door of the great violinist&rsquo;s
room. He knocked, and was admitted at
once. He found Fritz Lieber in a dressing
gown. Beside him was a table littered with
papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already up,&rdquo; he said, nodding at the sheets
of paper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been writing music. My
mind&rsquo;s fresh in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have my fiddle? Good! Grand!
Where&rsquo;s the blank? I&rsquo;ll sign it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t any blank. I&mdash;&rdquo; Curlie
paused in some confusion.</p>
<p>For ten seconds he looked into the frank
and friendly eyes of the great master. Then,
dropping into a chair, he told his whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;ve done well!&rdquo; exclaimed the
musician. &ldquo;Saved me from some bad hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this other?&rdquo; His eyes fell upon the
third package. He read the address at a
glance. Then he whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For them! You won&rsquo;t want to go around
there before daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here! What a fee they paid! What
can they have that is so very valuable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;do you know the people?&rdquo; Curlie&rsquo;s
lips trembled with excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not personally. At least they&rsquo;re no friends
of mine. But I know a lot about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the violinist went on in a
changed tone, &ldquo;my hobby is a sort of study of
people and nations and all that. How they
live, how they govern themselves, what becomes
of their money, and so on. And these
people,&rdquo; he continued with added emphasis,
&ldquo;are Bolsheviks. They represent the present
Russian government in America. They are
doing the best they can to stir up trouble here.
They would gladly destroy our present social
order, our government, and set up one similar
to the one they have in Russia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; his tone changed once more,
&ldquo;they are well worth a thought or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Curlie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of them
now and then myself. And I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve sort of admired
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admired them?&rdquo; The musician shot him
a quick glance. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their courage, and all that. Don&rsquo;t you
know? Doing things in a different way. Putting
down tyrants. Starting a government
where everything is owned by the people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something to be said for them.&rdquo;
Fritz Lieber&rsquo;s tone was thoughtful. &ldquo;They
were ruled by tyrants. There is no getting
around that. They were slaves. They had a
right to revolt. But now&mdash;now they have gone
too far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to live in a land that
denied the very existence of God?&rdquo; He
wheeled about to face the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fritz Lieber held up a hand for silence. &ldquo;In
a land where the authority of the Divine Master
is denied, where &lsquo;home&rsquo; and &lsquo;mother&rsquo; are
words that have no meaning, where the government
is doing its best to destroy home life,
where a little girl is not allowed to play with
dolls because she may want later to have a
home and children to call her mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like that!&rdquo; Curlie thought of
his own home and his own mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;The present powers that be in Russia, as
far as anyone can find out,&rdquo; the musician went
on soberly, &ldquo;wish in time to raise all children
in nurseries, as we do chickens in incubators,
to destroy most that has long been held sacred
by the nations of the civilized world. I know,
for I have looked deeply into these matters. I
have a friend in the United States Secret Service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that gives me an idea!&rdquo; he exclaimed
suddenly. &ldquo;You say a plane forced you down.
You think they wanted my violin. I doubt it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he laid one hand on the third
package, &ldquo;this is what they were after. They
would have it at any cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows what that package may contain?
Of late these secret agents of the Soviet,
these men who spread dissatisfaction among
the workers and the unemployed, have had
some secret source of wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the package and shook it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sound. And yet it is not money. A
long, slim package. Who sends money so?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, my boy!&rdquo; He turned upon
Curlie once more. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not try
to deliver this package. Take it to the post
office and get a receipt for it. That lets you
out. I&rsquo;ll report its arrival in Chicago to my
Secret Service friend. He can have it investigated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&mdash;thanks. I&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ll do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Curlie left the room with that mysterious
package under his arm it seemed to burn
his very flesh. That, of course, was sheer imagination,
nothing more. And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolsheviks. Hidden source of wealth,&rdquo; he
murmured to himself. Then he gave an involuntary
start. As he left the hotel, a shadow
crossed his path, then vanished.</p>
<p>It was that darkest hour just before dawn.
The alleys were deep wells of shadow. The
streets were deserted. A lone milk wagon in
the distance rattled over the pavement. Curlie
felt in his pocket. A single bill and some
change reposed there. He drew forth the bill
and unfolded it. By the uncertain light he read
a &ldquo;one&rdquo; in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No taxi this time,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;All of
eight miles, and I&rsquo;m practically broke. Street
car for mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>But there were no street cars, nor even
tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to go west.&rdquo; He turned a corner to
trudge along in the dark.</p>
<p>His active mind began going over the words
of Fritz Lieber. &ldquo;Bolsheviks,&rdquo; he murmured
once. And again, &ldquo;no church, no God, no future
life, no home, no mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;those men are
not really criminals. They are mistaken, that&rsquo;s
all&mdash;on the wrong track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes a rather hard sort of man to force
an aviator down in the dark. But then, did
they do that? Can&rsquo;t prove it. Can&rsquo;t prove
anything. Some band of robbers may have
learned of the value of this package. They
may have decided to force me down and take
it. Well, they didn&rsquo;t succeed. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were broken off by sounds of
an apparent struggle just ahead. There was
not time to step aside. Three men came tumbling
into him. Before the sudden impact he
went down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>He was on his feet in an instant. But during
that instant something was gone. For ten
seconds his benumbed senses registered nothing.
Then his lips parted in an exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The package! They have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a flash it came to him that this bit of
night drama had been staged in advance of
his coming.</p>
<p>There was a sound of hurrying footsteps.
He followed at top speed. The man before
him dashed through a door. He followed.</p>
<p>His mind was in a whirl. The package! It
must be retrieved at any cost. His position,
his reputation, perhaps his very freedom depended
upon that.</p>
<p>The man had gone dashing along a steel
track like a narrow gauge railway. He now
passed through a door and lost himself in the
very depths of the earth.</p>
<p>Once more Curlie followed. This was, he
thought, to be the strangest experience of his
whole life. Down a stairway, narrow and steep,
which ran through a cement tunnel scarcely
four feet across, they went down, down, down
into, it seemed, the very heart of the earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like entering a mine,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;But beneath this city there are no mines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to listen. A low rumble came to
his waiting ears. It grew louder, still louder.
It became a thundering, crashing confusion
of sound. Then it grew fainter and fainter
until it was once more a mere rumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I am,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;but I must go on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A SURPRISE PARTY</span></h2>
<p>It is strange how like the sea this world of
human beings is. On the sea a great ship
meets a little ship and greets it. They pass
from one another&rsquo;s view. They travel the
world over. Five years, ten, fifteen pass, then
they meet again. The same ships. New sails,
fresh paint, new spars, but the same old ships.
It is so with human lives. Men meet, become
acquainted, are associated in work for a time.
Then on the sea of life they part. In time the
great circle of living that regulates all men&rsquo;s
doings brings them together again.</p>
<p>Curlie Carson was not the only person who
entered into the grim mysteries of that great
city during the darkest hour just before dawn.
As you know, Johnny Thompson, his one time
pal, was also to witness that dawn. And so,
drawn closer and closer by who knows what
mysterious forces, their lives appeared about
to join again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>As the powerful car that bore the two youthful
detectives and their understudy into the
city passed down a particularly dark street,
Drew brought the car to a silent stop.</p>
<p>The next instant, crouching low and followed
closely by his silent partner, he sprang
out of the car, leaped across an intervening
space, and said in a tone that spoke of authority
backed by force of arms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move! Stay as you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next instant Tom Howe&rsquo;s slim hand shot
out as he uttered a sharper command. &ldquo;Keep
your hands above your hips!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got the break. It&rsquo;s in my right hip
pocket.&rdquo; It was Greasy Thumb who spoke
from the parked car which Drew Lane and
Tom Howe had just covered with their guns.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, with their guns removed
to a safe place in Drew Lane&rsquo;s pocket, Greasy
Thumb and Three Fingers were riding to the
police station in Drew&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What charge?&rdquo; Tom asked, after a time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Concealed weapons,&rdquo; Drew replied. &ldquo;That
will hold them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Drew Lane and Tom Howe were due
for a surprise. Forces of which they were not
aware were at work in this great, grim city.</p>

<p>No two cities are exactly alike. New York,
Boston, London, Paris; all these have
their subways, giant tunnels through which
thousands upon thousands of workers are
hurled to their day of toil. The metropolis of
our story has no subway; yet far down beneath
its busy streets forty, fifty, sixty feet underground,
one still finds life. Forty miles of tunnel,
a great spider-web network, pass beneath
this city.</p>
<p>It was into one of these tunnels that Curlie
Carson, while in pursuit of the man who had
snatched the precious package from beneath
his arm, had entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The roaring sound he had heard was the
approach and the passing of a tunnel train.
But such a train as it was! A narrow, box-like
electrical engine shooting out purple
sparks; a man with his hand on a lever; a
dozen cars the size of a city dumpcart, only
narrower and deeper&mdash;this was the train; for
these trains carry only freight.</p>
<p>Day and night, year in and year out, this
endless procession of tiny trains carries coal
to the heating plants of giant skyscrapers and
bears the cinders away. By this route, too,
thousands of tons of merchandise, shoes and
suits, cheese, cabbages, silverware, and socks
find their way to the great city department
stores or from factory to ship or train.</p>
<p>How many dwellers in the great city are
conscious of this life that throbs on and on
beneath them as they walk the city&rsquo;s streets?
Perhaps one in a hundred. Curlie Carson had
not so much as heard of these tunnels. Yet
he was passing down the narrow stairway
that led to a small landing platform. In less
than a moment he would be called upon to
make an instant decision which might spell
victory or utter defeat. And this decision
would have to be made in ignorance of that
which lay beyond him in those dim caverns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>It is often so in life. Always we are preparing
ourselves for an emergency. Are our
eyes bright, our minds clear and free from low
thoughts that drug the soul? If so, then we
are ready for the sudden, the unexpected.
Curlie was ready.</p>
<p>The thing that happened was this: As the
boy came stumbling down the last twenty
steps of that long stairway, he heard again
the ever-increasing rumble that told of an approaching
train. As he stepped at last upon
the dimly lighted platform he saw the man he
sought at the far end. The package was under
his arm. He was looking the other way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I have him!&rdquo; he thought, and his
heart beat a loud tattoo against his ribs.</p>
<p>Curlie was slim but strong, and agile as a
cat. He had a clear mind. He kept himself
fit. He had no dread of an encounter.</p>
<p>At this time at least there was to be no encounter.
For as Curlie sprang forward the
man turned and saw him. At the same instant
an empty train came rattling around the
curve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Urged on by who knows what desperate
need, the stranger played a bold hand. The
cars were moving rapidly. Not three feet
above them, charged with enough electricity
to kill a hundred men, ran a high tension
wire. Despite all this, the stranger made a
sudden leap, caught the side of a steel car,
struggled desperately, regained his balance,
and disappeared within its depths.</p>
<p>At that instant Curlie felt hope vanish. Despair
gripped his heart. The man with that
package, the loss of which meant to him dismissal,
disgrace, perhaps a prison, was rattling
away. Who could tell whither the car was
bound? Knowing nothing of these tunnels,
the boy could not so much as guess.</p>
<p>All this passed through his mind like a flash.
Cars still bumped and rattled by. It was a
long, empty train.</p>
<p>The boy looked up the tunnel. Except for
a narrow space above, the cars filled the tunnel
completely. If he attempted to duplicate
that man&rsquo;s feat and failed in the least detail,
he would meet instant death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Yet he could not surrender. Too much was
at stake. He had risked too much for others.
Now he must risk more for his own honor.
With a brief prayer for guidance and protection,
he put out both hands, gripped the edge
of a steel car, swung his feet high, caught the
gleam of copper wire above him, felt the shudder
of steel beneath him and then fell with a
force that stunned him to the bottom of the
car.</p>
<p>For a long time after that the train, bearing
its strange cargo, rattled on and on into the
perpetual night that is the tunnel system beneath
the great city.</p>
<p>The various sections of this intricate system
are placed in exactly the same manner as are
the streets of the city. Indeed, at their intersections
they are plainly marked: &ldquo;State
and Madison,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wabash and Monroe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Michigan
and Jackson.&rdquo; Had Curlie dared to raise
himself from the floor of the car he might at
once have determined his position in relation
to the city above him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The deadly copper wire warned him down.
&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he reasoned, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the good? One
does not rise through fifty feet of clay and
sand, rock and cement to burst up from the
street like a chick from an egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is in this tunnel an intricate system
of signal lights. Red just ahead warns the
operator of the engine that a train will soon
cross his path. Green indicates a clear track.</p>
<p>Once, when the lights were against the train
and it came to a jolting stop, Curlie rose to his
knees and stared ahead.</p>
<p>He could hardly make out the intersection
names, but thought it was Congress and Wabash,
a long way from the place he had left
when entering upon this surprising adventure.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch. It showed six
o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be looking for me,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;Supposing something happens to
me and I do not return at all. They will
search the city, the country, over for me.&rdquo; He
thought of good aviation pals who would
spare no pains to discover his whereabouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will always believe in me, as I in
them,&rdquo; he told himself stoutly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there will be others. Some will believe
I have betrayed my trust, carried away that
package and left the country to live on stolen
riches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Riches? What did the package contain?
Fritz Lieber had said it was not bank notes.
What then could it be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; he grumbled to himself.
&ldquo;Only one thing is certain. My company will
be obliged to pay a thousand dollars if I do
not get it back. It&rsquo;s insured for that much,
the highest registered letter insurance. I must
have it back. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the train came to a jolting stop.
This time as he looked ahead he saw that their
train stood squarely across another track.
Then he saw something that threw him into a
panic. The man he had followed so far was
coolly climbing out of his car, which at that
moment stood on the intersecting track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defeat!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p>It appeared to be true. So closely did the
cars hug the wall that it was impossible for
him to climb out and follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Yet, even as he despaired, the train started
again. Nerving himself for a second perilous
leap, he climbed out as far as he dared and
waited.</p>
<p>A second sped into eternity; another; and
another. Ten seconds, and then with a sudden
intake of breath he threw himself out of
the car.</p>
<p>He landed squarely, stumbled, then pitched
forward, all but under the grinding wheels.
Recovering his poise, he whirled about to go
dashing along the path the fugitive had taken.</p>
<p>Curlie was a fast runner. There was a good
chance that he might overtake the other one,
but his troubles were not at an end.</p>
<p>He sighted his man, redoubled his pace and
gained on him yard by yard. Now he was
twenty yards behind, now fifteen, now ten,
now&mdash;</p>
<p>But around a curve came blinding terror,
the headlight of a train that, bearing down
upon him, threatened instant destruction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Stopping dead in his tracks, Curlie glanced
wildly about him. He found no avenue of escape.
Cold and cruel walls were on all sides.
The engine and the cars filled all the space before
him. It seemed that he must be ground
to pulp.</p>
<p>Even as he despaired, something flashed by
him. It was the fugitive.</p>
<p>As when a bear and a wolf are stranded
upon an island in the flood they become harmless,
so for the moment Curlie had forgotten
the one he had pursued.</p>
<p>Turning, he attempted to follow, twisted an
ankle, fell flat before the on-coming train.</p>
<p>Only the clear brain of an engineer saved
him. Brakes screamed, wheels ground, the
engine came to a sudden stop, not ten feet
from the spot where he had fallen.</p>
<p>But what was this? There came a wisp of
smoke, then a sudden flare of light. The air
was filled with the smell of burning phosphorous
and brimstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matches!&rdquo; he cried, as he turned to flee.
&ldquo;One of those cars was loaded with matches.
The sudden jolt has set them off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>This time the race was joined by a third
person, the engineer. A lusty runner he was,
too. Full well he knew the danger of being
trapped in a narrow subterranean passage
filled with fumes.</p>
<p>He outran Curlie. The boy was three yards
behind when once more he stumbled and fell.</p>
<p>The fumes were upon him. He could feel
them in his eyes, his lungs. They were blinding,
stifling, stupifying. Yet he must not give
in.</p>
<p>Once more he was on his feet. He had not
gone a dozen paces when there appeared a
still greater terror. Before him, slowly, inch
by inch, but none the less surely, a pair of
massive iron gates were closing.</p>
<p>He understood in an instant. These gates,
placed at certain points in the tunnel, were
intended for just such an emergency as this.
When they were closed and a second pair behind
were likewise shut, the fire, a menace to
all workers in tunnels, would be confined to a
narrow space. The oxygen would soon be
burned from the air and the fire extinguished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must make it!&rdquo; he cried as his knees
threatened to betray him. &ldquo;I must! I must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet even as he struggled it seemed to him
that his case was hopeless. Scarcely two feet
of open space remained, and the gates were
still slowly closing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A MOMENT OF GRIM SILENCE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Drew, old boy, we win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Howe put out his hand to grip
his partner&rsquo;s solemnly.</p>
<p>It had been a stirring night. Now gray
dawn was creeping up the narrow canyons
that are a city&rsquo;s streets.</p>
<p>As we have seen, they had come, quite by
accident, upon Greasy Thumb and his undesirable
companion. They had arrested them
on suspicion. But suspicion holds no man in
jail.</p>
<p>They had found concealed weapons upon
them. But well enough they knew that in
this city no man could be held for such an offense
unless the arresting officer had a search
warrant. They had none.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>For all this, a bit of glorious good fortune
had come their way. In attempting to conceal
or discard a small package, Greasy Thumb&rsquo;s
partner had bungled. Tom Howe&rsquo;s eagle eye
had detected the move.</p>
<p>He had retrieved the package. And, of all
good fortune, he had found it marked with
the Air Mail&rsquo;s special stamp.</p>
<p>As he showed it to Drew, his eyes shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have thought they&rsquo;d keep
it,&rdquo; Drew whispered excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Tom drew ten one hundred
dollar bills from the envelope. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
they, though! It&rsquo;s wonderful what they&rsquo;d do
for money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added after a moment, &ldquo;the
thing seemed safe enough. Done in the dark.
No witnesses. No nothing. Clean get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where the rest of it is?&rdquo; Drew
mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d do all that for one
grand, a mere thousand dollars! They were
after something big. Wonder if they got it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, what became of the Air Mail
pilot?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mystery. He&rsquo;s vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Had they but known it, that air pilot was
at that moment beneath the city in that labyrinth
of subways, still in pursuit of the man
who had snatched the mysterious package
from him.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do with them?&rdquo; Johnny
Thompson broke in, poking a thumb at Greasy
Thumb and his partner in crime who stood
huddled sulkily in a corridor of the police
court building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take them right to the Chief,&rdquo; Drew
replied cheerfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll book them. We&rsquo;ve
got the goods on &rsquo;em. The world will not see
them again for many a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They led the prisoners to an elevator, rode
up two flights, walked down a dark corridor
and entered a room where a heavy-set man
with beady eyes sat behind a massive desk.</p>
<p>This was the Chief. He looked at the youthful
detectives through eyes that seemed heavy
for lack of sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Drew advanced in silence and placed the
Air Mail envelope on the Chief&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; The Chief did not look up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidence!&rdquo; the Chief exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what we need. The people are clamoring for
convictions. We must have evidence. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment he looked up and his glance
fell upon the cowering prisoners.</p>
<p>Like a pike caught on a spoon-hook, he appeared
to stiffen. He continued to stare
straight ahead.</p>
<p>At that moment a man Johnny had not noticed
before, a young man with a boyish face
but crafty eye, moved silently forward and
whispered in the Chief&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you boys been?&rdquo; the Chief demanded
almost savagely, as he wheeled about to
face Drew and Tommy. &ldquo;You know you are
supposed to report to me every day. This is
the fourth day. No report at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our report.&rdquo; Drew Lane held his
ground. He pointed at the envelope on the
Chief&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>At that moment Johnny Thompson stole a
look at Greasy Thumb and his man. The
change that had come over them gave him a
start. Gone were their dark and doleful looks.
They seemed almost cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, Chief,&rdquo; Greasy Thumb appeared
to hesitate, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a letter they took
from me by force. I received it by Air Mail
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I suppose your name is Robert
Deering,&rdquo; Drew Lane scoffed. Robert Deering
was the name on the envelope.</p>
<p>The wily crook hesitated, but only for a
space of seconds. &ldquo;Chief,&rdquo; he replied evenly,
&ldquo;it is. That&rsquo;s my name. As you know, I have
many enemies. I am living under an assumed
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the man beside the Chief bent
over to whisper in his ear. Drew Lane
frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this all the evidence?&rdquo; the Chief demanded
of Drew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, except that they were near the scene
of the Air Mail robbery last evening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give it back to &rsquo;em. Turn &rsquo;em loose.&rdquo; The
Chief&rsquo;s voice had taken on a hostile, almost
savage tone. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no law against receiving
money by Air Mail. You can&rsquo;t hold a man
on any such evidence. Turn &rsquo;em loose. Do
you hear me? Turn &rsquo;em loose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, after Greasy Thumb
and his partner had vanished, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
put you boys where it won&rsquo;t be so much trouble
to report to me. From now on you&rsquo;re on
court room duty. No more carnivals and baseball
games for you. You&rsquo;re on court room
duty, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one full minute by the clock Drew Lane
and Tom Howe stood where they were. It
was a minute of grim silence. The Chief sat
staring like an angry Buddha. The young man
behind him wore on his face one of those fixed
smiles that never become a sign of mirth.</p>
<p>Johnny looked first at Drew, then at Tom in
a vain attempt to understand.</p>
<p>At last Drew turned in silence and led the
way out of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;FIND THAT MAN&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Drew walked down the corridor, turned
to the right, entered the third door to
the left, waited for Tom Howe and Johnny
Thompson to enter, and then closed the door.
Dropping into one of the three hard-bottomed
chairs the narrow, box-like room afforded, he
sat looking out of the window, first down the
cement paved court, then far up to the tenth
floor where were many barred windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; Johnny asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean?&rdquo; Drew Lane pointed to the bars
above and across the court. &ldquo;It means that
the fellows behind those bars (and we put
some there, too) are going to have it soft compared
with us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got thirty days, maybe sixty. But
when that&rsquo;s over, they are free. But we&mdash;we
have an indeterminate sentence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Court duty!&rdquo; He threw out his hands in a
gesture of disgust. &ldquo;Know what that means?
It means that you stand all day with your
back against the wall, keeping guard against
disturbances that never come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You listen to well-dressed young men tell
the judge that their well-dressed young wives
will not try shop-lifting any more, if he&rsquo;ll let
them off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see ten or twenty colored men brought
in for shooting craps or drinking moonshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the time the court room smells of
garlic and sour beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sent out at all it&rsquo;s to bring in a
witness who has forgotten to appear. And
that takes about as much brains as a six-year-old
child has, and not half as much courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; he ended bitterly. &ldquo;Some
one has to do it. But why Howe and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he do it?&rdquo; There was pain as
well as disgust in Tom Howe&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief? Yes, why?&rdquo; Once more Drew
Lane lapsed into silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>After that the moments ticked themselves
away and not a single word was spoken.</p>
<p>Through Drew Lane&rsquo;s mind many dark
thoughts were passing. The Chief had thrown
them down. That seemed certain. Why? He
could form no answer.</p>
<p>The fact that they had made no report for
three days was not the reason. He was sure
of that. The same thing had happened many
times before, and there had been no protest.</p>
<p>It had been generally understood that he
and Tom Howe were to be free lance detectives
for the city.</p>
<p>This freedom they had welcomed. And,
happy in it, they had done their best to deserve
it. They had studied the city and the ways
of evil doers as a factory foreman studies his
plant. They had familiarized themselves with
hundreds of faces. They could actually call
hundreds of pickpockets, tin-horn gamblers,
stick-up men and general hoodlums by name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Not that they were friendly with them.
Quite the reverse. They were constantly on
their heels. Making it hard for them to do
wrong. Making it easy to do right? Yes, if
any sincerely wished it. But how few ever
did!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professional criminals.&rdquo; How those words
had been borne in upon them. What else
would such &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; do but rob and
steal?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Drew said aloud, bitterly, &ldquo;all
the months we have spent in preparing ourselves
for the great task of city detectives is
lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Tom said hopefully. &ldquo;The
Chief may put us back after a week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he!&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s tone carried conviction.
&ldquo;Did you see that look on his face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed Tom. &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, that was the question, why?</p>
<p>Dark forebodings took possession of Drew
Lane&rsquo;s mind once more. He knew full well
the power of the forces of evil in this great
city. There were millions of dollars at stake.
A man such as the Chief, sitting in a place of
high authority as he was, might be rich if he
but turned his back upon the gambling houses
and peddlers of poison labeled strong drink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Until now, Drew had admired and respected
his Chief. Had the lure at last grown too
strong for him? Had he fallen?</p>
<p>He knew the Chief&rsquo;s great ambition. In a
moment of relaxation he had taken the boy
into his confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew, old son,&rdquo; he had once said, &ldquo;when
I was a boy of sixteen I was not very strong.
Like the great Roosevelt, I was sent west for
my health. For one whole year I lived on the
range. I came to love it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, the wild, free life. The cattle
feeding. The sunset across the green of spring,
the brown of summer. The tents, the roasting
steaks. The wild, free out-of-doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, in winter, the big, roomy ranch house.
Cards, dances, and all the good times. I want
enough money to retire on a ranch like that.
Who wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Drew sighed, &ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t? But
the price!&rdquo; He sighed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks easy,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Just turn your
back. Hundreds have done so before you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Thompson,&rdquo; he said quite abruptly,
&ldquo;who is the meanest man in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A professional criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Johnny, you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s smile
was sad. &ldquo;No, Johnny. The meanest man is
the one who turns traitor to the cause he has
sworn to serve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it that we remember with real
hatred when we think of our American Revolution?
Is it Cornwallis?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not the man. Benedict Arnold, the
traitor, is the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right. But
you don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Drew Lane held up his hand for
silence. &ldquo;This is no time for thinking out
loud. We must wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting is not my long suit!&rdquo; exclaimed
Johnny, springing to his feet. &ldquo;I am long on
action. And why not? I am free. You have been
free lances for the city. I am a free lance on
my own. I can go where I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Tom Howe. &ldquo;Until the long
arm of the Powers of Evil reaches out and
gathers you in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;But until then,&rdquo; Johnny went on, not one
whit abashed, &ldquo;I shall do my utmost to solve
these mysteries. Did Greasy Thumb and his
gang rob the Air Mail? If so, what were they
after? And did they get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one thing more,&rdquo; said Tom Howe with
a smile of genuine admiration. &ldquo;What became
of that Air Mail pilot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Johnny. &ldquo;Looks like
that is the first real problem. Find that man
and perhaps secure a witness who can explain
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed the others in unison.
&ldquo;Find that man!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE DOORS CLOSE</span></h2>
<p>During all this time what had been happening
to the air pilot, Curlie Carson,
Johnny&rsquo;s one time pal?</p>
<p>We left him forty feet below the city&rsquo;s
streets in a narrow tunnel with fumes of sulphur
filling in behind him, and steel doors
closing before him.</p>
<p>Curlie Carson could not remember the time
that he was not conscious of some all-pervading
presence hovering over and protecting
him. Call it what you will, this feeling gave
him calm confidence.</p>
<p>With all the remaining strength that was
in him, he threw himself forward and through
the door.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he passed than the doors closed
with a sickening thud, and he dropped to the
floor, exhausted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>He was soon on his feet, however. There
was work to be done. The package that meant
so much of honor or disgrace to him was still
in the hands of the mysterious stranger.</p>
<p>Turning, he raced down the narrow tunnel.
Coming to an intersection, he paused to listen.
The trainman had disappeared. For a time
the echoing tunnels were still. As he placed
his ear to the ground he caught the sound of
receding footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off to the left,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;and he is
not running. He thinks I am no longer on his
trail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On tiptoe, not making the least sound, he
went speeding down the tunnel.</p>
<p>The man had gone farther than he thought.
In such a place sound travels far. The tunnel
here, too, was strange. He covered the
distance of a long city block, yet came to no
intersection. He doubled the distance; still no
track crossing this one. The place grew
strangely still. The very stillness of it frightened
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a tomb.&rdquo; He shuddered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Once more he dropped upon the track to
apply his ear. To his consternation he caught
no sound of footsteps. Despair seized him.
What could have happened? Had he gone in
the wrong direction? Had he lost his man?</p>
<p>The thing was unthinkable. The package
must be recovered at any cost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;I have not lost him.
He is still here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to grow suspicious. A cold chill
ran up his spine. Perhaps the man was lurking
in the shadows waiting to strike him down.
Seeing a two foot length of strap iron lying
beside the track, he grasped it firmly in his
good right hand and pressed on.</p>
<p>He had not gone a hundred paces when suddenly
the passage broadened and came to an
abrupt end.</p>
<p>He had entered what appeared to be a blind
alley in the tunnel. And here there was no
one.</p>
<p>A quick look about him showed a large
freight elevator, used, no doubt, for lifting
cars to a level some twenty feet above him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>He examined the walls. Bars and braces
made them easy to scale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went up there,&rdquo; Curlie told himself.</p>
<p>But had he? Doubts assailed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he did, and perhaps not,&rdquo; he
thought, calming a little. &ldquo;At least it is the
only way out, and I shall find myself out of
this hateful place which has so nearly cost
me my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping a bar, he began to climb. A lusty
pull here, three steps up, a swing, a final struggle,
and he lay for a moment on a cement floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he thought, as he glanced about
him, &ldquo;where am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where indeed? All about him in the large
room were packing cases. Some were small,
some quite large. Many of them bore freight
labels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will mysteries never end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed out into a larger room. The place
was quite dark, and that in spite of the fact
that it must now be morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Approaching a narrow packing case that
had been pried open, he threw the light of his
electric torch into it. Then he started back in
horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A skeleton!&rdquo; he cried aloud.</p>
<p>One circle of his light told him where he
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The basement of the Museum,&rdquo; he thought,
and instantly felt better.</p>
<p>A narrow flight of stairs brought him to a
dimly lighted floor above.</p>
<p>There was no one there. The place was still
as death.</p>
<p>Hastily tiptoeing down the aisle, he came
at last to an open window. This window was
a scant ten feet above the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went out here,&rdquo; he assured himself.</p>
<p>Clambering out he fell to the grass, then
took a survey of the grounds about him. On
every side was an open park. Except in one
direction the view was unobstructed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could have disappeared only by hiding
in that clump of trees,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
wait there until he thinks I&rsquo;m gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go around the corner out of sight, and
wait for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Three minutes later he found himself crouching
against a stone wall, waiting in the stillness
of the morning.</p>
<p>But even as he waited, doubt assailed him.
Had the man truly left the tunnel?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That window may have been opened by a
caretaker,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;And after all,
what an ideal hiding place that labyrinth of
tunnels would make! Why, a man might hide
there for weeks and even a regiment of soldiers
might fail to come upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So now assailed by doubts, now filled with
hope, he waited in the dawn.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A LADY DETECTIVE</span></h2>
<p>In that ancient Book called Genesis it says
that God saw that it was not good for man
to live alone. So He gave him a woman to be
his companion. Johnny Thompson had read
that old Book. He had learned, too, by experience
that a man and woman, or boy and girl,
fighting side by side, shoulder to shoulder,
will go farther along the road to success in any
endeavor than will either alone. It will not
seem strange, then, that as he launched forth
on a fresh adventure, as he prepared to carry
forward the business of solving the mysteries
back of the sinister events that had led to the
downfall of his good friends Drew Lane and
Tom Howe, he should think first of securing
a partner for this adventure. And who could
better occupy this post of honor than Joyce
Mills, daughter of a great detective and partner
of Johnny in many a previous adventure?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Johnny was not long in seeking her out.
Fortune favored him. He arrived just at her
lunch hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place like a crowd for talking,&rdquo;
he assured her. &ldquo;Come over to Biedermann&rsquo;s,
on Adams Street. It&rsquo;s a German grill. You
can get a swell cut of flank steak and all the
trimmings for thirty-five cents. And there&rsquo;s
so much racket thrown in that not a soul will
hear what we say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyce joined him gladly. To her, every new
eating place was a fresh adventure.</p>
<p>After they had eaten the steak and onions
and were sipping iced tea, Johnny told of his
new adventure.</p>
<p>Briefly he described his experience at the
&ldquo;Greatest of All Carnivals,&rdquo; of Greasy Thumb
and his con game, and of the Gray Shadow.
He even produced the roll of bills that had
played so large a part in that night&rsquo;s adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Had he known all, he might well have regretted
this move; for scarcely had he slid the
roll deep in his pocket than two small men
with sharp eyes and nervous, twitching fingers,
sidled from their table to pay their check
and leave the room. As they gained the street,
the shorter of the two placed a hand to his
mouth to say in a hoarse whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marked money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unconscious of all this, Johnny went on
with his story. By a telephone call to the office
of the Air Mail station he had secured
some details regarding the packages that had
disappeared with the young pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that one package carried
the heaviest insurance possible on a registered
package, and that it was mailed to a
rather dingy section of the city. That in itself
seems strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does.&rdquo; Joyce sat up with sudden interest.
&ldquo;Unless you know some things. Would
you believe it? I can almost name the consignee
of that package.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s face showed his astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might, if I would,&rdquo; she replied soberly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; her eyes glowed with fresh fire,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve all but turned radical. It&rsquo;s working in
the store that&rsquo;s done it, I guess. When you
see girls, fine young things with splendid
bodies and keen minds, working for fifteen or
eighteen dollars a week and trying to make a
go of it, it sort of makes you hate the millionaires
who own that pile of brick and stone and
merchandise they call a store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that thing of marble out on the
lake front.&rdquo; Her eyes burned like fire. &ldquo;That
place where they keep fish, live fish for folks
to look at! It cost a million, they say. Built
by a man who ran a big store. Built for a
monument to his name, and paid for by the
labor of ten thousand folks just like me! Who
wouldn&rsquo;t be a radical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Johnny agreed quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt
that way myself. And yet it is so easy to go
too far.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the girl sighed a trifle wearily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of that, and I&rsquo;ve about given the
radicals up. Not till I became a Comrade,
though. And I happen to know that they were
expecting a priceless package. And the address
is about where you say it would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did?&rdquo; Johnny leaned forward.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something worth knowing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;They
wouldn&rsquo;t endanger an Air Mail pilot&rsquo;s life by
forcing him to land in a pasture at night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling what they would do.&rdquo;
The girl paused to consider. &ldquo;To them the
&lsquo;cause,&rsquo; as they call it, is all important. Everything
and everybody must be sacrificed to that.
But where would they get an airplane and a
pilot, much less a radio station? Well, they
might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to find out.&rdquo; Johnny gripped her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything for you.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes
were frank and fearless.</p>
<p>Then suddenly her face was clouded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;where is my father?
I have not seen him for days. I am worried,
frightened for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me find him.&rdquo; Her words were a cry
of pain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more thing, Johnny.&rdquo; She leaned over
to whisper in his ear before they parted. &ldquo;I
am not a book sales person at the store. That
is a blind. I am a store detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Johnny could recover from his astonishment
at this fresh revelation, she was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;so that
dark-eyed girl has put one over on me. She&rsquo;s
a store detective!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After sober reflection he realized that the
thing was logical enough. The girl was born
a detective. Her father, one of the greatest
of them all, had always inspired her. Girl
though she was, she had resolved to follow in
his footsteps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;she couldn&rsquo;t
get on the city force. Too young for that.
But a great store; that&rsquo;s different. They use
the material they have at hand. And a young
girl, even in her late teens, would be of service
to them. The shoplifters, the purse snatchers,
all that light-fingered tribe, would hardly suspect
her of being a dangerous person. Even
her fellow employees would not suspect her.&rdquo;
Full well Johnny knew that all too often
youthful employees of a great store, dazzled by
all the wealth and splendor about them, fell
before temptation and began secretly carrying
away small articles of merchandise for
their own use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that makes it hard for the honest
ones,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>He paid his check and was about to leave
the place when, to his surprise, a young man
tapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; The other&rsquo;s
tone was apologetic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mike Martin from
the World. Reporter, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny recognized him on the instant. He
it had been who stood behind the Chief, whispering
in his ear while Drew Lane and Tom
Howe were being so neatly shelved.</p>
<p>He felt an instinctive dislike for the man,
and yet he was obliged to admit that he knew
nothing against him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; The reporter led
him to a corner of the room. &ldquo;I want to tell
you some things that will be for your good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you know,&rdquo; he smiled deprecatingly,
&ldquo;we reporters get into all sorts of
strange places. We meet all kinds of curious
people; have to know them. That&rsquo;s our job.
Crooks, judges, police captains, Senators, all
the rest. The more we know the more news
we get and the straighter we have it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see it happens I know a lot about
you.&rdquo; He tapped Johnny on the knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Johnny stared. &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people are more important than they
appear to be. Some little people, if they blunder
about, cause a great deal of trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re interested in Drew Lane and Tom
Howe.&rdquo; His tone had changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes, I&mdash;they&rsquo;re my friends. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well enough. But you think they&rsquo;ve
been unjustly treated. You think you can stir
matters up and have things changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care!&rdquo; He leaned forward with a
hand held up for warning. &ldquo;You may change
things in a manner that will get you in bad.
Very bad indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean by that?&rdquo; Johnny
was on the defensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me how I know.&rdquo; The reporter
leaned forward to whisper in his ear. &ldquo;It is
the business of a reporter to know much and
write what he thinks is safe; at least that&rsquo;s
best for him. And in this world it&rsquo;s every man
for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I happen to know,&rdquo; his voice dropped
still lower, &ldquo;that you have in your possession
a roll of marked money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marked money! There it was again. Johnny
started. How could this reporter know so
much?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That money,&rdquo; the reporter went on, &ldquo;will
be your undoing. Unless you walk a very
straight and narrow path, you are going to
suffer. You will sing your psalms on Sunday
behind iron bars and make shoes or clothes-pins
during the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prison,&rdquo; the boy thought with a shudder.
The money appeared to burn a hole in his
pocket. &ldquo;Why did I take it? I&rsquo;ll get rid of it
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The reporter appeared to read his mind.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do a bit of good to dispose of it now.
Those men have witnesses to swear you took
it, and others who will say under oath that
they saw you with it later. That&rsquo;s evidence
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you,&rdquo; he went on smoothly, &ldquo;I am
not threatening you. Why should I? I am
only a reporter who knows things. I am telling
you what is safe. All you have to do is to
drop this whole affair; forget it. Take the
money. Go on a fishing trip. Have a good
time; you&rsquo;ll not be molested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the money!&rdquo; Johnny protested
indignantly. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo; The reporter put a hand on
his arm. &ldquo;Think it over. Iron bars; work in
a shoe factory run by the State, behind iron
bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny stared after him.
What did it all mean, anyway? A whispering
reporter with such a warning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Just what Johnny thought of this whole affair
after ten minutes of reflection may be
judged by what he did.</p>
<p>Pulling his cap down over his eyes in a determined
way he made for the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoes,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Always did want to
know how to make a pair of shoes. Lots of
people can write a book or paint a picture.
How many of them could make a pair of shoes.
And you can learn all that for practically nothing.&rdquo;
He chuckled in a mirthless sort of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find that missing aviator,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;And then, we&rsquo;ll&mdash;then we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SECRET SERVICE</span></h2>
<p>The young Air Mail pilot whom Johnny
had, for the tenth time that day, decided
to search out, had not been idle.</p>
<p>Two long hours he had crouched beside the
wall of the museum waiting for the one who
had robbed him of the precious, mysterious
package. He waited in vain. At last he gave
up hope.</p>
<p>With leaden feet and drooping spirits he left
the park in search of a restaurant.</p>
<p>A hot breakfast revived his spirits. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
back and face the music,&rdquo; he told himself with
a grim set of his jaw. &ldquo;What I did was, I
judged, for the greatest good of all, and no
man can do more than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He climbed a stairway, boarded an elevated
train and went rattling away toward the distant
airport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>He settled back in his place for half an
hour&rsquo;s ride and allowed his thoughts to wander.
They were long, long thoughts. He was
the youngest air pilot in the mail service. He
had worked hard to reach that goal. The
money for his flying instruction had been
saved bit by bit. When he had earned an air
pilot&rsquo;s license he still had a long way to go.
Little by little, he had piled up hours of successful
flight until he was considered eligible
for the Air Mail service. Months as a substitute,
with an occasional flight, had preceded
his regular commission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now this!&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>He had not entered the service through a
desire for adventure alone. He wished to serve
his country. Knowing how rapidly the air
service was developing, he had decided that
there lay his great opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romance, adventure,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s all some people see in this airplane
business.&rdquo; He had once heard Lindbergh say
that piloting a great passenger plane was
about as exciting as driving a truck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he smiled grimly, &ldquo;the last few
hours have shown me adventure enough.
Forced down by an unknown pilot in the
night.&rdquo; He wondered now who his assailants
could have been. He no longer believed they
had been after the priceless violin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that other package sent by one radical
group to another. But what did it contain?
What must it contain to incite men to such
reckless deeds of intrigue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw now where he had made his mistake.
Having learned from the noted violinist, Fritz
Lieber, something of the nature of the package
he was carrying and of the people to whom
it was addressed, he should have moved with
greater caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late to think about that now,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;Have to go to Crane and tell my
story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Robert Crane, Jr., was District Manager of
the Air Transportation Company. He was
young, a college graduate, and son of a rich
man. Curlie had seen little of him but had always
feared him. Old men of long experience,
whatever their importance in the world of affairs,
never frightened him. But of a young
man in a high position he simply did not know
what to expect, that was all.</p>
<p>Thus it was with many misgivings that he
sought out the young manager&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Robert Crane sprang to his feet the instant
the boy entered the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delivering the mail in person, I am told.
Since when has our company held that contract?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an emergency,&rdquo; Curlie was getting
control of himself, &ldquo;when there is great need
one does what seems best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; The manager indicated a chair.
Curlie sat down. &ldquo;Now tell me about it, but
be brief. There&rsquo;s a man from the Government
Secret Service waiting in the back office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie shuddered, cleared his throat twice,
spoke a few words, choked up, took a fresh
start. Then securing a firm grip on himself
he proceeded to tell his story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The young manager sat erect in his chair.
The clock ticked off the seconds. From somewhere
far away came the rumble of an airplane
motor. When the boy had finished he was
aware that he had told his story well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;ah&mdash;&rdquo; The young manager started
to speak as Curlie finished, then stopped to
stare at the ceiling. He punched two holes
through a blotter, looked up, then punched
three more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undecided,&rdquo; the boy thought to himself.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s young. That&rsquo;s the trouble. An older
man would know exactly what to do. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk to that man.&rdquo; Robert Crane
broke in on his thoughts. He rang a bell. A
girl appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show in Mr. Simons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later a short, stout man with
bristling gray hair appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Curlie Carson,&rdquo; said the manager,
&ldquo;our man.&rdquo; Curlie liked the way he said &ldquo;our.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sit down. I&rsquo;ll tell you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simons sat down. &ldquo;Secret Service,&rdquo; Curlie
thought, and shuddered anew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>In the five minutes that followed Curlie&rsquo;s
admiration for Robert Crane grew by leaps
and bounds. He told Curlie&rsquo;s story to the Secret
Service man, told it as the boy could not
have told it, and all in the space of five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if he is a rich man&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; Curlie
said to himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not to blame for that.
He has his work to do in the world just as the
rest of us have. He&rsquo;ll do it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his story,&rdquo; Robert Crane finished,
&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t forget this; it&rsquo;s <i>our</i> story as well.
He is <i>our</i> man. We trust him; don&rsquo;t hire a man
we can&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s <i>our</i> man. We&rsquo;ll back him with
the last resource we can command!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lump rose in Curlie&rsquo;s throat. He felt that
he was about to disgrace himself with tears.
So this was Robert Crane, the young man he
had feared!</p>
<p>Regaining control of himself, he turned to
face the Secret Service man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Mr. Crane, quite right,&rdquo; Mr.
Simons was saying. &ldquo;But the young man&rsquo;s
conduct has been&mdash;well, irregular. One
doesn&rsquo;t open locked mailsacks with a knife, not
as a common thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;And this affair,&rdquo; he leaned suddenly forward.
&ldquo;You are not aware, perhaps, that this
innocent looking package contained a king&rsquo;s
ransom in jewels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie stared. Crane started to speak, then
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact.&rdquo; The Secret Service man&rsquo;s voice
cracked like a pistol. &ldquo;Smuggled in. Part of
the Crown Jewels of Russia. Reds over there
had &rsquo;em. They decided to risk sneaking &rsquo;em
here to be sold over the grapevine trail. Then,
like as not, they&rsquo;d spend the money trying to
make this a Godless country without families
or homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;for all we know
they will succeed! Who has that package
now? Tell me that! Who but some Bolshevik?
Who dares even guess it is anyone else?
And where is our Government&rsquo;s rightful customs
duty on those jewels? Gone. Hundreds
of thousands, to say nothing of the inestimable
harm that that money will do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>He reached for his hat. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to
get that man!&rdquo; He went stumping out of the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s about all.&rdquo; There was a kindly
look on the young manager&rsquo;s face, as he
turned to Curlie. &ldquo;You need sleep. Better get
some. And don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll fix it, we and
God. Don&rsquo;t ever forget that God is in on every
transaction, either for or against us. We
try to be on His side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie did not speak. He could not. He
turned and walked slowly from the room.</p>
<p>He was hardly out of the door when he was
confronted by an eager-faced young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is Mr. Carson in
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Curlie Carson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; the boy thought to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Grace Palmer,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;and I
wanted so much to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace Palmer. Worse and worse. He had
never heard of her. Here was fresh mystery.</p>
<p>Yet, if he had but known it, this sudden
meeting was to figure largely in his destiny.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;THE VOICE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>In this life of ours, years become months,
months become weeks, weeks narrow down
to days, days dwindle to hours, hours to minutes;
then the unexpected happens.</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson was about to meet his
one time pal. Once more their lives were to
be joined in a great adventure. But not yet.
Years, months, weeks, days had dwindled, but
hours had not yet become moments in the
hourglass of fate.</p>
<p>Johnny was on his way to Curlie&rsquo;s airport.
He stood on the curb, waiting for the westbound
car, when someone touched his elbow
and demanded in some surprise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was &ldquo;The Ferret,&rdquo; the silent worker of
the detective world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Enough has happened,&rdquo; Johnny answered,
not at all displeased by this surprise meeting.
&ldquo;Drew and Tom have been shelved. Greasy
Thumb has been found and turned loose. I
am shortly to take a course in shoemaking behind
iron bars. And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; stopped him. &ldquo;It
can&rsquo;t be as bad as that. Give me a few details.
Come on in here. It&rsquo;s a crooked dump of a
place, but I&rsquo;m known, or at least they think
they know me.&rdquo; He smiled a twisted smile.
&ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s an off hour. There&rsquo;s sure to be
no one here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was right. The small, barn-like room
they entered was deserted. Doors on three
sides were closed. For all this, Johnny felt
that they were watched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak low,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; said, as he took
a place beside a table worn smooth by cards
and dice. &ldquo;No one will hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny told all that had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; declared
when Johnny spoke of the marked
money. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t dare try it. Send you
to prison? That&rsquo;s a huge joke!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;They might put you on the spot, or take
you for a ride. Hardly that, though. Not yet.
You&rsquo;ve not caused them enough trouble. But
watch out. When the heavy hand falls, it falls
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time he sat in an attitude of deep
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;ve shelved Lane and Howe!&rdquo; Johnny
heard him mutter. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something for
the Voice. I&rsquo;ll give it to him. And how he&rsquo;ll
love it! How he&rsquo;ll ride &rsquo;em for it! Great boy,
the Voice! But it&rsquo;s a dangerous game. Suppose
they find out. Just suppose they do?&rdquo;
He shrugged his shoulders, then shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he talking about now?&rdquo; Johnny
wondered to himself. He wanted to ask who
this Voice might be. He did not quite dare.
So there, for a time, the matter dropped. But
not for good nor for long. A new, powerful
and altogether strange force was about to enter
this uncertain and apparently uneven battle
for the right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A HEAVY DATE</span></h2>
<p>Grace Palmer, Curlie Carson learned
at once, was the daughter of Professor
Palmer, and sister to the child whose life he
had done much to save.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought her medicine. You saved her
life. She is my only sister.&rdquo; The young eyes
were filled with honest tears of gratitude.</p>
<p>Curlie hated tears. They made him feel
awkward and out of place.</p>
<p>But Grace Palmer was not one to spill them
needlessly. She was a girl of purpose and
strength. Grace Palmer, Curlie would discover
soon enough, was not the average type
of girl. Reared beneath the shadows of stately
university buildings, she had unconsciously
acquired something of their quiet dignity. At
this moment she wore a hand-tailored suit of
dark blue broadcloth. The suit made her appear
a good deal older than she really was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Yes, Grace Palmer was a dignified person.
She was possessed of a good mind, and her
father had seen to it that her mind was trained
in the art of thinking. For all that, beneath
the almost severe broadcloth coat there was
a heart that was capable of beating very fast
at the thought of mystery and adventure. She
was not sorry to be on her present mission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father has classes,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;He
teaches. I am studying, but my periods are
all in the afternoon. He asked me to drive
out here and thank you. He&mdash;he also wanted
me to ask you if the&mdash;the way you delivered
our package got you into any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has,&rdquo; Curlie said, rather bluntly. &ldquo;Plenty.&rdquo;
He was tired; wanted to clean up and
rest. Anyway, what could a girl do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My troubles,&rdquo; he said, taking a step toward
the door, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but they do!&rdquo; Impulsively her hand
gripped his arm. &ldquo;We&mdash;we owe you so much.
We can help, I am sure. Won&rsquo;t you let us?
Won&rsquo;t you tell me about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Curlie could not resist this appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, as a ghost of a smile flitted
across his face, &ldquo;if I fall asleep, you must
waken me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way to the fresh outdoor air.
There he dropped upon a bench.</p>
<p>He told his story briefly. But to his own
surprise, led on by the girl&rsquo;s expressions of
sympathy, excitement and consternation, he
told it well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she exclaimed as he finished, &ldquo;you
say the man went east from the museum? Perhaps
he went over to the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Island?&rdquo; Curlie stared. &ldquo;There is no
island off that shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but there is one, a mile and a half
long. There are to be others. Men make
them with dredges and dump trucks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really quite an old island,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;Trees on it twenty feet tall and some
shacks where men live; three or four shacks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shacks? Men?&rdquo; Curlie&rsquo;s voice was full of
suppressed excitement. &ldquo;Perhaps the man
who stole that package lives there. Perhaps
the package is there still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;that may be true. Shall
we go and see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie paused for thought. A film seemed
to close over his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head. &ldquo;No. Not
now. I&rsquo;ve reached my limit. I&rsquo;m no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need rest,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;But
can&rsquo;t I come back for you later? It&rsquo;s really
considerable of an island. I go there often.
And truly I think it&rsquo;s worth looking into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Curlie acquiesced, &ldquo;you come. Any
time after six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later in the airport bunkroom
he lay quite still, lost in deep sleep.</p>
<p>He was awakened in mid-afternoon by a
newsboy calling his papers. As he listened,
still half asleep, he thought he caught words
that sounded like &ldquo;Air Mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was out of his bunk at once. Had it
appeared in the papers&mdash;his story?</p>
<p>He threw up his window and sent a coin
rattling to the pavement below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bring one up,&rdquo; he shouted. The boy pocketed
the coin, waved and disappeared.</p>
<p>He reappeared almost at once by the bunkroom
door, with a cheerful:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here y&rsquo;are, mister. All about the Air Mail
robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie dropped down on his bunk and stared
in amazement. There it was, on the front
page of the afternoon scream-sheet. Two
planes in mid-air; this drawn by a staff artist.
His own plane on the ground; a real photograph.
And his picture in the oval inset.</p>
<p>He read the story breathlessly. There was
much there that he did not know. His plane,
so the story ran, had been rescued and brought
into port. No damage had been done. The
number of mailsacks taken was not yet known.</p>
<p>The story made him out quite a hero. He
flushed when he thought how he had bungled
matters in the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No clue as to the assailants</i>,&rdquo; he read on.
&ldquo;<i>An unlicensed radio station, surprised and
overhauled in the vicinity of the attack, offered
no real clue.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>One thousand dollars reward offered by
the air transport company for return of the missing
package.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of them to make the offer,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s one reward that will go
unearned.&rdquo; Little he knew!</p>
<p>The picture that interested him most was
one running entirely across the top of the second
page. In this were shown the smiling,
happy faces of scores of crippled children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Their concert saved</i>,&rdquo; was the caption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said with conviction, &ldquo;is even
worth going to jail for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden he recalled his engagement with
Grace Palmer to visit that island. He looked
at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to dress and have a bite to eat,&rdquo; he
told himself, as he began hurrying into his
clothes.</p>
<p>As he stepped out of the airport on his way
to the lunch room across the street, he all but
collided with an old time pal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Thompson, as I live!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Curlie Carson!&rdquo; Johnny gripped his hand.</p>
<p>The invisible threads of silken dreams that
had been drawing them closer and closer had
brought them together at last.</p>
<p>They talked for a moment or two of old
times and far-away places.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden, Johnny started. &ldquo;But
I can&rsquo;t talk any more now.&rdquo; He turned about.
&ldquo;Came here to find an Air Mail pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&mdash;?&rdquo; Curlie stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He brought the mail from New York. Was
forced down; plane robbed. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare your breath,&rdquo; Curlie grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
the guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; Johnny stared in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surest thing in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on over and have a cup of coffee.
Got a heavy date with a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Professor&rsquo;s daughter. Thinking of taking
a course in something or other myself,&rdquo; Curlie
bantered. &ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seated on lunch counter stools, devouring
ham and egg sandwiches and drinking coffee,
the one time pals told of their experiences.</p>
<p>Johnny listened in silence to Curlie&rsquo;s account
of his narrow escape, his forced landing,
his night wanderings as a messenger boy, his
thrilling adventures in the tunnel beneath the
city. When he came to the point where he
had lost the trail of the one who had snatched
the package of rare jewels (if, indeed, the Secret
Service man&rsquo;s statement were correct) he
straightened up and put a hand on Curlie&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think.&rdquo; He was in
deadly earnest. &ldquo;That fellow never left the
tunnel. Why should he? Finest hiding place
in the world. What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt about it. For all that, I think
he did leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong. Come with me to the tunnel,
and we&rsquo;ll find him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t. Got a date to search an island; date
with that college girl, Grace Palmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An island?&rdquo; Johnny pondered. &ldquo;Oh, yes,
I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did remember many things about
that island. Thrilling adventures had come to
him there when the island was younger, as
you will recall if you have read the book called
<i>The Fire Bug</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be something to it,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Well, you look that place over and
I&rsquo;ll take a look at the tunnel. Somehow, we
must find that man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Greasy Thumb and his pals were at
the bottom of this Air Mail robbery, or I&rsquo;m a
green one. Thing to do is to get evidence,
then get them. Next time they&rsquo;ll stay in jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing troubles me most of all.&rdquo; His
brow wrinkled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way the Chief
acts about the whole affair. Then, too, there&rsquo;s
that reporter. He&rsquo;s certainly a queer one. You
don&rsquo;t expect to find anything wrong with a
reporter from a paper like the <i>World</i>. They&rsquo;re
always on the side of decency, and honest reform.
Oh, well, we may be all wrong about
everything. Time&rsquo;ll tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better hurry over and keep your
date. I hope we&rsquo;re going to be seeing a lot
of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope so.&rdquo; Curlie hastened away.</p>
<p>They were indeed, and the result was to be
adventure such as seldom comes to any one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN ISLE OF MYSTERIES</span></h2>
<p>Grace Palmer arrived late. It was
growing dark when her car pulled up
before the hangar. She came alone. Curlie was
surprised. He had expected her to bring the
chauffeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to pardon me.&rdquo; She smiled as
she threw open the door. &ldquo;Usually I arrive
at the tick of the clock. But I had a blowout.
The old bus described a parabola and nearly
put me on the curb. But hop in. We&rsquo;ll get
there all right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie climbed in and they were away. He
was beginning to have a comfortable feeling
about this new friend. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;is unexpected aid.&rdquo; And aid was what he
needed. In spite of the fact that his youthful
employer had treated him in a magnanimous
manner, he felt morally responsible for the return
of that mysterious, and supposedly priceless,
package.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;If that Secret Service man knew what he
was talking about,&rdquo; he said to Grace Palmer,
&ldquo;those fellows were not only beating the Government
out of thousands of dollars in customs
duties, but were planning to use the
whole proceeds for the purpose of striking
what blows they might at the land that feeds,
clothes and protects them. And if they get
away with it, I&rsquo;ll be to blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t get away with it,&rdquo; Grace Palmer
said stoutly. &ldquo;We will see to that!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In the meantime, Johnny Thompson had
not been idle. He meant to enter the tunnel
where Curlie had, quite by accident, lost himself
and nearly lost his life in the bargain.</p>
<p>It was, he found soon enough, quite an unusual
thing for the entrance to be left unguarded.
When he tried to go down, a watchman
stopped him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have to get a permit from Mr. Rusby,&rdquo;
he told the boy gruffly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the office.&rdquo; The man jerked a thumb to
the right. &ldquo;No. Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; He consulted
his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. Gone home. You&rsquo;ll have to come
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had no notion of waiting until to-morrow.
The tunnel would, he reasoned, be
used less at night. That would give him greater
freedom in making his search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than forty miles,&rdquo; he grumbled.
&ldquo;Forty miles of tunnel. Like looking for a
pearl in a gravel pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all that, he hurried to the office, caught
a belated office girl, secured Mr. Rusby&rsquo;s telephone
number from her and then hurried to a
drug store.</p>
<p>But there he came to a halt. Mr. Rusby, he
was informed, was out and was not expected
back before eleven o&rsquo;clock. And no one at
his home could tell where he was to be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;So there you are.&rdquo; Johnny banged down
the receiver. &ldquo;May as well go back to the
shack and listen to a few tunes on the radio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did just that. But he heard more than
tunes on the radio that night. What he heard
started a fresh mystery. It made him sit up
and think sober thoughts, too. You may be
very sure of that.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Curlie and the college girl were on the island.
A curious sort of island it was. The
early explorers had not discovered it. There
was reason enough for that; it had not been
there.</p>
<p>Men had made that island, men and trucks,
pile-drivers, dredgers, and more men. The
refuse from a great city: ashes, old cans, glass,
and the clay from beneath many a skyscraper
had gone into its making. And with these,
sand, much sand from the bottom of the lake.</p>
<p>It is strange how nature hates ugliness. Men
had left this island ugly. Nature had added
a touch of beauty. Wind had sifted sand over
all. Cans, glass, ashes were buried. Trees and
bushes had grown up. And now it was a place
where one might stroll with pleasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>But Curlie and the girl, as you know, had
not come here for a stroll.</p>
<p>Almost at once they stumbled upon something.
What? They could not tell.</p>
<p>They had climbed over a great heap of
rocks, used as a breakwater, and were about
to descend an even higher pile when the girl
gripped Curlie by the arm and pulled him
back. At the same time she put a finger to his
lips.</p>
<p>He listened. At first he heard nothing save
the distant, indistinct murmur of the city. And
then there came the sound of heavy footsteps.
After that, silence.</p>
<p>And into that silence came a voice. Low
but distinct, it said, &ldquo;Shall we bury it here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl gripped Curlie&rsquo;s arm till it hurt.
Yet he made no sound.</p>
<p>His heart raced. Bury what? The package
of jewels, to be sure. What luck! Or was it
so lucky after all? They were not armed.
These were likely to be desperate men&mdash;men
who stop at nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>What was to be done? They were in the
midst of a pile of giant, jagged rocks. Beyond
the rocks on one side was water, on the other,
sand. On the sand, not five yards away were
men, strange men. And in the darkness they
were burying something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be?&rdquo; whispered the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Curlie whispered back.</p>
<p>He touched the girl&rsquo;s arm for silence. What
was to be done? The men were between them
and the bridge that led to the island from
the city.</p>
<p>It was a lonely spot. True enough, the
lights of a great city, ten thousand lights,
gleamed in the distance. But that distance was
too great. The sandy surface of a man-made
island, a deep lagoon and broad park spaces
lay between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we stir they will hear us,&rdquo; the boy whispered.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move. They may go away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>They heard the sound of scraping in the
sand and the puffs of exertion. Moments
seemed hours. The girl felt a cramp taking
possession of her right foot. She made a furtive
attempt to relieve it. Then came catastrophe.
A stone, dislodged by her foot, rolled
down with a thud which in that silence seemed
a crash.</p>
<p>A muttered exclamation was followed by
heavy footsteps. Curlie seized the girl&rsquo;s arm
and fairly hurled her over the rocks. The
next instant, with the men in hot pursuit, they
were dashing away over the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some building over there,&rdquo; Curlie panted.
&ldquo;Have to try for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did try. But Curlie could fly better
than he could run. He was short of breath.
The men gained on them, a yard, two, three,
five yards. They almost felt the breaths of
their pursuers.</p>
<p>Curlie tried to think what it would mean if
they should stumble.</p>
<p>They rounded a second breakwater and
there stood the building. But such a building
as it was! A low structure of many sides and
a large dome. It seemed a tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not a light!&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s heart sank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>There was nothing to be done but to race
on. Heavy footsteps, labored breathing were
behind them; the city was far away. They
reached the wall of dark marble. No doors
there. They began circling this astonishing
edifice.</p>
<p>Their pursuers were all but upon them when
they came at last to a door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not locked!&rdquo; the girl said aloud. &ldquo;It
<i>must</i> not be!&rdquo; She put out a hand and turned
the knob. The door swung open. They tumbled
in. Then, as if by magic, the door closed
and locked itself.</p>
<p>Curlie knew it was locked, for a heavy hand
on the outside knob failed to budge it.</p>
<p>The knob was all but wrenched away to no
purpose. After that came silence, deep and
ominous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the boy whispered with a nervous
laugh, &ldquo;here we are. But where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And where, indeed, were they? Aside from
a tiny gleam of red light that seemed far
away, the place was utterly dark. This feeble
light, casting not the faintest shadow, appeared
to make the darkness more intense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed in an audible whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;ah,&rdquo; came echoing back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like some terrible cellar!&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s&mdash;let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Futile suggestion. This unusual door had
locked itself automatically both within and
without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go to the light,&rdquo; Curlie said. &ldquo;This
way. We&rsquo;ll find our way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straight toward the staring red eye they
marched. Twice they bumped into stone pillars
and were obliged to detour. But at last
they reached the spot directly beneath the
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A door!&rdquo; the boy exclaimed tensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not locked!&rdquo; Grace Palmer had tried
it.</p>
<p>The door opened and they passed beyond.
Once more darkness confronted them, darkness
and a stairway.</p>
<p>Up the stairway they went on hands and
knees.</p>
<p>A third door, more darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>But no, not complete darkness. Off to the
right was an oblong of pale light.</p>
<p>Toward this they moved with caution.</p>
<p>The oblong of light formed an open doorway.
The space beyond that door was more
mysterious than anything they had yet seen.
There were no lamps anywhere, but pale light
was about them everywhere. A vast pale dome,
like the sky, hung above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! It <i>is</i> the sky!&rdquo; whispered the girl.
&ldquo;See! There is the moon! And there the stars,
pale stars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed true. Surely there was the
moon, and there the stars; yet Curlie was
puzzled. The moon seemed too high, the stars
too bright. What could it all mean? His
head was in a whirl.</p>
<p>More was yet to come. As they stood there
motionless, gazing upward, the entire firmament,
the moon, the planets and the stars began
to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; breathed the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>They did not move rapidly, this moon, these
stars. There was something dignified and terrible
about the slow and leisurely manner in
which they traversed the great dome above.</p>
<p>For fully three minutes not a sound was uttered.
But when the moon vanished beneath
the horizon and a million stars shone with
added brightness, the girl seized Curlie&rsquo;s hand
to drag him into the outer darkness.</p>
<p>She led on blindly until a second red light
appeared. Followed by her companion, she
passed through a door and mounted a long,
winding stairway, to find herself at last out
in the clear, cool air of night, with a very different
sky above, a sky full of stars, all set with
a gorgeous, golden moon that did not move,
at least not so you could see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;this is better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Curlie, feeling the cool lake breeze on
his cheek, gazed away at the island that lay
before him and at the dark waters far and
away beyond, he wondered what had really
happened, after all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>When they had regained their composure
they began an investigation which told them
they were on a narrow circular promenade
some thirty feet above the surface of the
island.</p>
<p>Fortunate for them was the fact that workmen
engaged in mounting statues on the ledge
had left their scaffold standing.</p>
<p>After a careful survey of the ground below,
to make sure that their pursuers had left, they
nimbly made their way down to earth and
bounded away in a silent race for the car.</p>
<p>To their vast relief they found it unmolested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Curlie, as they sat once more
in the car, with the motor purring, ready for
a dash at a moment&rsquo;s notice, &ldquo;what about
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;is one of the strangest
things I ever experienced. But of course,&rdquo;
she laughed softly, &ldquo;you know what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Curlie, slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a planetarium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A planetarium. You may come here any
day and see the stars, the moon, the sun and
all the rest do their stuff. The old man who
runs it must have been practicing up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Curlie was nonplussed. He was obliged to
admit that the place had had him guessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was a refuge. Question
is, what are we to do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might let the police in on this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to. Guess the thing is safe
enough till morning. Either it is an important
discovery, or it isn&rsquo;t. Either they buried it, or
they didn&rsquo;t. If they did they&rsquo;re not going to
dig it up the same night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the way they left it. The girl was
to pick Curlie up at seven o&rsquo;clock. Curlie was
to arm himself, and they were to return to
the island to make a more thorough investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring a garden spade,&rdquo; the girl said in
parting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I a gun,&rdquo; Curlie chuckled. &ldquo;Spades
and guns. Regular pirates.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">JOHNNY HEARS THE VOICE</span></h2>
<p>That night Johnny Thompson went in
search of a man. In making this search
he met with adventure, such adventure as no
person would go far to seek.</p>
<p>But before that he heard a voice. And that
voice, coming as it did from the air, thrilled
him to the very tips of his toes.</p>
<p>He was seated in the shack, the very shack
you have come to know so well from reading
<i>The Arrow of Fire</i>&mdash;the one Drew Lane had
rented from nobody in particular. It was, you
will recall, surrounded by brick structures of
some size. But, like some stunted little pine
among a forest of giants, a relic of the past,
it had held its place during all the changing
years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>A fishing shack it had been at one time, perhaps,
when the shore of the lake was several
blocks closer to the heart of the city. Now it
served as a home for Drew Lane and Johnny
Thompson, together with anyone who might
have met with misfortune and come under the
observation of these youthful philanthropists.</p>
<p>At the moment Johnny was not thinking of
philanthropy, but of crime. &ldquo;Why is it,&rdquo; he
was asking himself, &ldquo;that men are willing to
place themselves outside the law? Why will
they steal and kill? Why bring airplanes down
in the night, or snatch a package from an honest
boy who is trying to do his duty?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably money,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;But
money for what purpose? To pay rent? Buy
food? Not often. Money for pleasure, gambling,
gaudy clothes, high-power cars, drink.
These are what the money buys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too often they wish to ape the rich. And
what do the foolish sort of rich people do but
put on a big show? Huh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the subject with disgust, to wonder
about other matters. He thought again of that
haunting Gray Shadow that, appearing and
disappearing, seemed to guard his destiny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;An angel of light,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Wonder
if I&rsquo;ll ever see him face to face. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off short to listen. Just before the
air of the room had been filled with the melodious
notes of Titl&rsquo;s Serenade. Now, as the
notes died away, without announcement someone
broke in with the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Voice!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;Where
did I hear that expression before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the voice was going on. It was telling
the people of this great city, at an hour when
they were at home and in a thoughtful mood,
just what their city was like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Voice.&rdquo; The tones were low and
mellow, a kindly, almost pleading voice. &ldquo;This
is your city and my city. It is our home. We
have always lived here. We love it. And yet
it is a graft-ridden, crime-ridden city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Voice. I must tell you of these
things. I, the Voice, am hidden away. I will
be hidden. No one knows my name. The announcer
does not know, the station manager
does not know. No one sees me. No one will
see me. I am only a Voice. Each night at this
hour I will tell you of our city. I will tell you
many things that it is disturbing to hear; yet
you must hear them. It is my duty to speak;
yours to listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny thrilled and trembled at the sound
of this Voice. It was as if the Voice was no
real person, but one returned from the dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the Gray Shadow,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;So unreal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the Voice seemed unreal, the events
it was to speak of next were real enough, as
Johnny was in a position to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one little group of facts to-night,&rdquo;
the Voice went on, &ldquo;then I am done. A few
hours ago, a known gunman was arrested.
Damaging evidence was found on his person.
Two young detectives who have built up an
enviable record for themselves, brought him
in. The evidence was placed before the Chief.
The Chief returned the evidence. Why? A
man whispered into his ear. Why? The gunman
was released. Why?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;The young detectives have been placed in
a position where they can make no more arrests.
Why?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A certain reporter is said to have unusual
influence and power with the City Council and
civic officials. Why?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Voice. I bid you good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the instrumental trio was on the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this Voice?&rdquo; Johnny asked himself.
&ldquo;How did he know all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of &ldquo;The Ferret.&rdquo; Now he recalled
that he had said something about the
Voice. But what voice? Was it this voice?
He could not be sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to ask him,&rdquo; he told himself. At that,
he was not sure he would ask &ldquo;The Ferret.&rdquo;
Some affairs are best left secret. This Johnny
knew well enough.</p>
<p>He went to the telephone and called a number.
Ten minutes later he was out of the shack
and on his way to the entrance of the city&rsquo;s
freight subway. He had gained permission to
spend the night there. And such a night as it
was to be!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN THE TUNNEL AT NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>The narrow tunnels far beneath the din of
this vast city&rsquo;s streets were built in the
main to serve great enterprises. The steel cars
that rattle on and on through the night carry
coal to factories and many-floored department
stores. The lighter cars, with frames of wood,
transport shipments of goods from the stores
to outlying districts where they are loaded on
trucks and delivered. Manufactured goods are
hurried away to warehouses and depots.</p>
<p>Thus it happened that Johnny, entering as
he did at the dead of night, found men still
toiling in these narrow burrows where the
light of day never comes.</p>
<p>There are many entrances to these tunnels.
Most of these are elevators wide enough to
lift two or three cars from the depths below
to the street level above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>The one chosen by Johnny that night led
through a soap factory. There the air was
heavy with the clean, perfumed scent of soap.</p>
<p>A man in a shabby sheepskin coat received
him in silence, motioned him to a place at the
corner of a loaded elevator, clanged an iron
gate, and set the elevator to sinking into the
earth.</p>
<p>There is something deeply depressing about
being lowered beneath the natural surface of
the earth. Whether it be a well, a mine, a cave
or a tunnel, it is all the same. Johnny Thompson
was not free from this feeling of depression.
Indeed, so powerful was its influence
that it was with the utmost difficulty that he
resisted an impulse to go straight back to the
surface. As you will see later, he was to have
reason to regret resisting this impulse.</p>
<p>However, once he had accustomed his eyes
to the weird green and red lights of the place,
and his ears to the great din when a train
passed and the vast silence when there was no
train, he found himself feeling more at home
than he had imagined possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;One can see,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;why men
might even enjoy working here. The air, circulated
by powerful fans, is pure. It is not hot
in summer nor cold in winter. There is no
glaring light and no real darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was taken to the portion of the tunnel
which he wished to inspect. This portion was
the one nearest the museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no trains on the spur leading
to the museum,&rdquo; the trainman told him. &ldquo;On
that track you&rsquo;ll be safe enough. If you wait
for the green lights, you&rsquo;ll be fairly safe on
other tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After imparting this information the engineer
threw on his switch and went rattling
away, leaving Johnny to the silence of a night
in a tunnel.</p>
<p>Night in a tunnel. What strange life exists
here to come creeping boldly about at night.
A black bat, snapping his teeth at who knows
what insect, goes whirring by. A mouse comes
creeping forth to munch some morsel that has
fallen from a workman&rsquo;s lunch box. Two
squealing rats go scurrying away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Night,&rdquo; Johnny murmured. &ldquo;Night, half
darkness, bats and rats. And who knows what
greater perils?&rdquo; He shuddered, then hurried
on. In his right hand he gripped a large revolver,
a relic of one of the raids made by
Drew Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to have to fire it,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;Wow! What a rumpus it would kick up down
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not know that ere the night was
over he would hear an explosion which would
make the sound of his gun seem but the low
pop of a pea-shooter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A NIGHT&rsquo;S GRIM BATTLE</span></h2>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s journeys on foot that night
were long and varied. In the spur leading
to the museum there were no lights. He was
obliged to depend upon his electric torch. This
cast weird shadows. Every now and then he
fancied he detected a crouching figure ahead.
Each time as he advanced it proved to be only
a pile of supplies in a niche in the wall, or a
padlocked tool box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably no one anywhere,&rdquo; he grumbled
to himself. &ldquo;Great waste of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was wrong. There was someone.</p>
<p>Coming at last to the end of the museum
spur, he examined the elevator carefully. He
did not attempt to ascend to the museum as
Curlie had done. Instead, he turned and retraced
his steps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>On the return journey he did not exercise
the caution resorted to on coming to the museum.
It did not seem necessary. He was
looking for someone who might be in hiding.
The person had not been found. It was natural
to suppose that on his return he would
find no one.</p>
<p>In this world one must learn that nothing
may be taken for granted. With his flashlight
pointed at his toes, Johnny had not gone a
hundred paces on his return journey before,
to his vast surprise, a figure sprang up from
the darkness directly before him and went
sprinting down the track.</p>
<p>So astonished was he that for a full ten
seconds he stood motionless. This gave the
fugitive a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been following me,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s
mind registered at last. &ldquo;Wonder why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next thought was: &ldquo;He may be my
man!&rdquo; This startled him into action. Throwing
his light far ahead, he saw the man plainly,
even his face, for just then he looked back.</p>
<p>It was a wild sort of face, with a stubby
beard, unkempt hair and no hat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;is not my man. And
yet&mdash;a day and a night in a tunnel. Who
knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he sprang away after the fugitive.</p>
<p>From the museum to the main line of tunnel
is three eighths of a mile. The man was
not a good runner. Johnny was. He gained.
Foot by foot, yard by yard, rod by rod, he
shortened the distance between them. Now he
was five hundred feet behind, now three hundred,
now two hundred, now&mdash;</p>
<p>But suddenly, as they neared the main line,
the fugitive stopped. He appeared to place
something in the center of the track. Then
at redoubled speed he raced on.</p>
<p>At that moment Johnny seemed to hear a
voice cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Go back! Back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was it a human voice? Was it a superhuman
voice, or was it no voice at all? In the
light of that which followed Johnny will always
believe it to have been a human voice.</p>
<p>At any rate, he obeyed. He stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>It was well that he did. Ten seconds had
not passed when the whole world appeared
to have been blown into fragments.</p>
<p>Johnny was thrown twenty feet, to go
crashing against the wall. He rolled over
once, then lay quite still.</p>
<p>For a short time the place remained in utter
silence. Then there was a sound; but
Johnny did not hear it. It was a most ominous
sound. It increased in volume as the seconds
passed. It was the sound of rushing water.
Above the tunnel, between it and the surface
of the street run the great water mains
that quench the city&rsquo;s thirst and protect it
from devastating fires. The explosion had
torn away the thin tunnel wall and had broken
one of these water mains.</p>
<p>What would follow was a thing prearranged
and quite automatic. Great iron doors at the
end of the museum spur would close. This
would confine the flood to the spur. The main
tunnel would be safe from flood. In time the
motor would be shut off and the main mended.
Not, however, until the museum spur had been
filled with water, perhaps for hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>In the meantime Johnny lay where he had
fallen. He was quite still. Was it the stillness
of death?</p>
<p>Before the low rising tide of water, rats, a
whole army of them, went scurrying away.
Some raced over the boy&rsquo;s unconscious form.
Still he did not stir. And Johnny had always
held rats in great abhorrence.</p>
<p>Creeping like some vile reptile, the water
advanced. Now at a depth of two inches, it
reached the boy. It rose.</p>
<p>And now at last the prostrate form appeared
to stir. High time, too!</p>
<p>Did he throw out an arm? No. It was but
the water lifting the arm.</p>
<p>So this was the end. And such an end for
so gallant a soul! Ever striving to be of service.
Always on the side of the right. Forever
fighting ignorance, cupidity and crime. What
a pity! Well, they had got him at last. Put
him on the spot, perhaps. Who knows?</p>
<p>The water became deeper. The silent form,
even in its defeat, appeared to struggle against
death. It rose and sank, rose and sank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>But what is this? Comes a splashing. A
figure is approaching, an odd figure, one
clothed from head to toe in a long gray coat
and a gray cap. His face is all but hidden by
this cap and a gray beard.</p>
<p>Had Johnny&rsquo;s lips moved, they would have
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gray Shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did not move.</p>
<p>And now began one of the grimmest battles
ever fought in the dark. From this spot to
the main tunnel was but half a block. But
there the door was closed. There appeared to
remain but one hope, the museum end.</p>
<p>Seeming to realize this the strange being,
who appeared possessed of great strength, lifted
the boy to his shoulders and began making
his way through the flood to that distant goal.</p>
<p>The distance was long. The water rose rapidly.
Now the water rose to his knees, now to
his thighs, now to his chest. He had covered
but half the distance when he was lifted off
his feet and obliged to swim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Undaunted, he struggled on; yet what hope
was there? The water now filled half the tunnel.
The end could be but a few moments
away. To reach the museum was impossible.
Yet the gallant Gray Shadow struggled on.</p>
<p>The space above the water narrowed. Now
it was four feet, now three, now two. Death
by drowning; what must it be in such a place?</p>
<p>At last the hands ceased to move. Was the
battle over?</p>
<p>No. Not yet.</p>
<p>Into that darkness, from somewhere far
above, stole a very feeble ray of light. What
was it? Whence its origin? There were no
other stations. The museum was far away.
And yet here was light. One look, and the
Shadow redoubled his efforts.</p>
<p>He had understood. This light was a ray
of hope. Nor was hope entirely vain. A fresh
avenue lay above him. When a new building
is to be erected in the city and the excavation
is going forward, a narrow chute is sunk to
the tunnel. Down this chute the excess earth
is run into cars and is thus carried away without
cluttering up the streets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>One of these chutes lay just above the Gray
Shadow and his burden. Could he but drag
the unconscious form into the chute they
would be safe for the moment.</p>
<p>To tell of the struggles of this lone figure
there in the night; how he tried five times to
drag the body to safety, only to fail; how at
last he succeeded in bringing his burden into
the chute; how he struggled up and up; how
the slippery clay more than once defeated his
aim and threatened ultimate catastrophe; and
how at last just as dawn was breaking, he
emerged, an unrecognizable figure, dragging
one quite as unrecognizable, would require
many pages of print.</p>
<p>It is enough that he did emerge triumphant;
that he did find water in a pool and bathed the
boy&rsquo;s face as best he could; that he felt the
pulse quicken, saw the eyes open; noted the
approach of workmen to their day of toil, and
then slunk once more into the shadows where
he appeared to belong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;WE WILL DIG HERE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The forces of nature are never at rest.
Man makes his mark upon the earth.
Nature destroys it. A day may be required for
the task, a year, a generation, a thousand
years. It is all the same to nature. She wins
at last and the man and his works are forgotten.</p>
<p>Shortly after Curlie Carson and the college
girl left the island, a storm arose; not a violent
storm, but a storm nevertheless. Storms are
ever changing the face of nature, not alone in
the sky, but on the earth as well. This storm
set the waters of the lake into motion. Waves,
with increasing violence, beat on the sandy
shore that lay close to the breakwaters on
which Curlie and the girl had stood. Tiny particles
of sand were loosened from the mass and
thrown high in air. The north wind caught
them. Like a kitten with a ball, it teased
them, tossing them about. In time it had a
million of these racing about at its will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>But now one particle, tiring of the play,
dropped into a shovel mark and stayed there.
Others followed and soon there was no mark.
Some lodged in a footprint and in time the
footprint joined the shovel mark in oblivion.</p>
<p>When Curlie and the girl, still troubled over
the fact that the mysterious package had not
been found, and that Curlie was responsible
for the loss, and still wondering what those
men had meant to bury and if after all they
had buried it, arrived at the spot where the
men had labored, they found it flat as a floor.
Not a trace of any digging could be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one dug here,&rdquo; said Grace Palmer in
disgust. &ldquo;We must have made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Curlie, positively. &ldquo;This is the
place. Back here in the rocks is a piece of
driftwood with a nail in it. I scratched myself
on the nail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said with a laugh, &ldquo;is the scratch,
and there the nail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will dig here,&rdquo; he said a moment later.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the cause of the
pick-up in their heart beats as Curlie threw
out the first shovelful of sand. The girl had
stayed up until the wee hours, reading in her
father&rsquo;s library. She had found there a description
of the crown jewels of Russia. Curiously
enough, the thing that had interested
her most was the description of a tiny train,
made of platinum and set with diamonds, that
was made to fit snugly in a large golden egg.
This she knew was a perfect model of the
one time private railway train of the Czar.
&ldquo;Only a plaything for a prince,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;But what a plaything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, as Curlie dug, her hopes rose and fell.
So, too, did Curlie&rsquo;s, for the success or failure
of this enterprise meant much to him. True,
his youthful employer had sworn to stand by
him; but this did not remove from Curlie&rsquo;s
shoulders the responsibility of having allowed
a priceless package to escape from the hands
of the law and come into the possession of
those who openly regard themselves as enemies
of the Government he gladly served.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>For a long time the shovel uncovered nothing.
They were beginning to despair when
at last it touched something hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; Curlie breathed hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only it is!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes shone.</p>
<p>A moment of furious digging and then they
uncovered&mdash;not the parcel-post package, but
something long and slim, done up in oilskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Curlie in disgust, &ldquo;may interest
some one. It does not interest me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw it down on the sand.</p>
<p>The girl took the trouble to unwrap it, but
was hardly more impressed when she found it
contained a very old and much tarnished telescope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she sighed, replacing it in its
oilcloth covering, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll take it along. May
interest father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well have a look at that thing
over there,&rdquo; said Curlie with a sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know of anything more exciting to do just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>They made their way toward the Planetarium
which in the light of day lost most of its
mystery.</p>
<p>At their request the aged professor made
the sun, moon, stars and planets do their little
part in their artificial universe.</p>
<p>The Planetarium, as you doubtless know,
consists for the most part of a great white
dome. Inside this dome one may sit with comfort
while a great bug-like affair made of steel
and glass, winking and blinking through its
scores of white eyes, reproduces for him the
starry heavens and throws in the planets, the
moon and the stars for good measure. It was
in this dome that the boy and girl had strayed
in their flight of the night before. They had
chanced to arrive just as the professor was
testing some new form of projector.</p>
<p>With the light of day outside, all this
seemed rather commonplace. But when they
showed the professor what they had found beneath
the sand, he fairly sprang at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the sand.&rdquo; Grace stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Out there.&rdquo; She pointed out the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was stolen early last evening.&rdquo; He took
it from her as if afraid it would disappear
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, handling it with real affection,
&ldquo;is one of the oldest telescopes in existence;
perhaps the oldest. When you think
how much the telescope has done to widen
man&rsquo;s knowledge of the universe, you will
know how priceless it is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;since you have done
me and this institution I serve a very great
service, what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One little thing,&rdquo; the girl smiled. &ldquo;Find
us the crown jewels of Russia. You&rsquo;ll know
them when you see them. There is a tiny
platinum train set with diamonds that is kept
in a golden egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor stared at her as if he believed
she had lost her senses. But when the full
story was told over a cup of coffee in the professor&rsquo;s
study, he readily enrolled himself as
one of that growing band who were pledged
to unravel the mystery of the missing parcel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>The human mind behaves in a strange manner
at times. Here were a boy and a girl who
had come to a man-made island to search for
stolen treasure. They had happened upon men
who were burying an ancient telescope, and
had been frightened away.</p>
<p>Returning next day when they might have
searched the whole island at their leisure, they
unearthed the telescope, returned it to the custodian,
had their morning coffee, and went
away.</p>
<p>The island with its grove of young cottonwoods,
its many breakwaters, its drifting
sands and its three shacks of driftwood built
by men of strange names and no reputation,
remained quite unsearched.</p>

<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ONLY A VOICE</span></h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s recollection of
that affair in the tunnel will always remain
decidedly vague. A wild face, a fleeing form,
a voice in the dark, a terrific explosion, and
after that darkness and silence.</p>
<p>Some workmen saw a tall, mud-bedraggled
figure emerging from the deep gash in the
earth which formed the setting for their day
of toil. By the time they had found Johnny,
this mysterious figure had vanished.</p>
<p>Johnny was taken to the Jefferson Street
First Aid Station. There it was found that
he was suffering from nervous shock and a
bump on the head. A warm room and a steaming
cup of coffee did much to restore him. As
for the bump, it might interfere with his hat
for a day or two; otherwise it was not serious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where was I?&rdquo; he asked of the nurse, when
he felt himself capable of straight thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were found in a hole where they are
preparing to build a skyscraper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was in the tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tunnel?&rdquo; The nurse had not heard of it.</p>
<p>Johnny told her about it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s down forty
feet underground,&rdquo; he ended. &ldquo;How could I
have come to the top?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably swam,&rdquo; the nurse laughed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better forget all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did not take her advice. He puzzled
over the affair for some time. Later fortune
would lead him to the spot where he had been
found. After watching the workmen shovel
earth into the hole that led to the tunnel, he
would guess that he had come up through that
hole. His manner of coming would remain
a mystery for some time.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon Drew Lane brought
Johnny a fresh suit of clothes. When he had
dressed they went together to the shack which
you will recall as their home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>There they spent an evening in quiet talk.
Drew Lane said things were no better at the
police court. He and Tom Howe were kept
standing around like old men with rheumatism,
or racing around on errands like messenger
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marking time,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Doing nothing
of real use. All our knowledge of crime and
criminals going to waste. And still the crime
wave goes merrily on. Three killings so far
this week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom is thinking of asking for a transfer
to outlying districts where he can walk a beat.
Says there he can at least help little children
over dangerous crossings, and that&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; He rose to pace the
floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stick it out. Things will
change. You&rsquo;ll see. We&rsquo;ll get a break. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came to a sudden pause. He listened.
The radio had been on&mdash;music, and they had
not been conscious of it. But now, as on that
other night, some one broke in with the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Voice.&rdquo; Drew wrinkled his brow.
&ldquo;What voice?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Johnny held up a hand.</p>
<p>They did listen. For fifteen minutes not a
sound was heard in the room save this voice
coming in from the air.</p>
<p>This night the Voice told the people of the
city what he thought of certain men they had
elected to office: the mayor, certain aldermen,
the heads of boards. He charged them with
graft and corruption, of winking at thefts from
the city treasury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are hard words!&rdquo; was Drew Lane&rsquo;s
comment when the Voice had ended. &ldquo;But every
word is true. How does he get his facts,
I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow,&rdquo; he added after a time, &ldquo;will
get himself bumped off. They&rsquo;ll put him on
the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can they, when he&rsquo;s only a voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a voice? Who&rsquo;s only a voice? They&rsquo;ll
find him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. Do you know,&rdquo; Johnny
smiled, &ldquo;the other night he talked about you
and about Tom Howe, too? What he said
then was true, too; only he didn&rsquo;t go very far.
If I only could, I&rsquo;d tell him; but I can&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s
only a voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a voice,&rdquo; Drew Lane mused. &ldquo;Only
a voice, and with many a great message to
deliver to the countless thousands who listen
in every night. What an opportunity! And
yet, only a voice? It can&rsquo;t be done. I tell you,
Johnny, they are devils, these crooks! They&rsquo;d
hunt you out and put you on the spot, kill you.
Know what I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s words were
almost a prayer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE NAMELESS ONE</span></h2>
<p>Next evening Johnny met some one who
thrilled him to the very center of his
being. And yet, when he thought of it quite
soberly in the shack afterward, he could
scarcely tell why.</p>
<p>He came, quite unexpectedly, upon &ldquo;The
Ferret.&rdquo; It was in a little underground restaurant
where the walls were of imitation stone
and all the dishes of a curious Dutch pattern.</p>
<p>So much absorbed was &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; in
something a youth about Johnny&rsquo;s age was
saying that he did not notice Johnny at once.
When at last he did see him he sprang to his
feet with an exclamation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a lucky meeting! Let me introduce
my&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off abruptly, appeared quite
confused, then ended rather lamely, &ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;a
friend who is very much one of us. He
has, you might say, a burning desire to be of
some service to his city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny scarcely needed to be told that this
youth was consumed by some great desire.
He could read it in the two smouldering coals
of fire that were his eyes. Indeed, as he recalled
the meeting later and tried to summon
a mental picture of this new-found friend, he
could visualize only a pair of glowing eyes,
that was all.</p>
<p>Johnny was invited to join them at their
evening meal. What was said during that half
hour Johnny does not recall. That it was unimportant
is to be assumed. That which followed
was important. The nameless youth
invited him for a walk. And what a walk it
turned out to be!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>At a rapid stride the stranger led the way
straight out of the business section of the city
into a wilderness of apartment houses. Nor
did he pause here. On and on they went. A
mile of streets filled with children, of apartments
where home lights were glowing. Here,
through some windows they caught glimpses
of little circles gathered around the evening
meal, of happy groups about a piano, or some
elderly couple seated reading beside a lamp.</p>
<p>A mile of this, two miles, three. Few words
were spoken. &ldquo;And this is what he calls a little
walk!&rdquo; Johnny all but groaned aloud.</p>
<p>Still there was no pause. Four miles, then
five and six. Johnny was beginning to believe
it was a practical joke, when suddenly the
strange youth turned upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Thompson,&rdquo; he said, with his eyes
fairly glowing in the night, &ldquo;have you seen
those homes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many were there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thousands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many honest people live in them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people are honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s tone was deeply earnest.
&ldquo;Here is a city filled for the most part
by honest folks. Yet it is ridden by crooked
politicians and grafters; it is in the grip of the
criminal element. This grip cannot, or at least
has not been shaken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I believe, Johnny
Thompson?&rdquo; He gripped Johnny&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I
believe that this world was made for good,
honest, generous, clean-minded people to live
in, and that when it has become impossible for
such people to live without being poisoned by
moonshine, robbed by grafters or shot by
holdup men, it is time for some of those who
are honest and good and clean to die that their
city may be made right again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was it,&rdquo; thought Johnny. &ldquo;A sermon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty impressive one, at least. And I believe
he is sincere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Johnny replied a moment
later, thinking things out as he went along.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s well enough to take a sporting chance,
to join hands with those who endeavor to enforce
the law, to help them try to work the
thing out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just to throw yourself in the face of
certain death&mdash;if that&rsquo;s what you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean just that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Johnny drawled, &ldquo;all I have
to say is, life is mighty sweet to me. I like to
see the sunrise over the water in some deep-shaded
bay, to see it set amid the golden glory
of the clouds, to see the stars come out one by
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love music the best of all. I like to hear
children sing and see them go skipping over
the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my friend,&rdquo; he added soberly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
willing to take a chance. But when it is no
longer a chance, when death becomes a grim
certainty, I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;d have to leave me
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth said not another word. They
boarded a street car and went rattling back to
the heart of the city. All the way the nameless
one sat with chin on breast. The fire that
was in his eyes appeared to have burned out.</p>
<p>And yet, as they left the car he exclaimed
with renewed heat: &ldquo;All the same, I am sure
there is no other way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was to recall this statement long
after, and marvel at it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; the stranger said, as they stood
at the parting of the ways, &ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; his tone
was very serious, &ldquo;tell me about these two
young detectives. Are they grandstand players?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandstand players!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone showed
his astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one has said they are. I wouldn&rsquo;t
want&mdash;well, no matter what I wouldn&rsquo;t want
to do. But you know them. Tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandstand players!&rdquo; Johnny was indignant.
&ldquo;If you were held up by a man whose
criminal record for robbery and killing is as
long as your arm; if you were off duty and
armed only with a small pistol, while he had
a regular cannon; if you tackled him alone in
the dark, with no one to watch the play; if
you fought him for ten minutes; if he got his
gun to your head and pulled the trigger, but
it failed to go off; if he bit you to the bone,
fighting like a demon; if you won at last; if
you got your man, would you call that grandstand
stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the boy solemnly, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drew Lane did that. And Tom Howe is
not one inch behind him. If all the coppers in
this town were as square and as fearless as
Drew Lane and Tom Howe, this city would be
clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny told the youth with the burning eyes
much more about his two pals of the police
department. To his surprise, he found him
taking notes. This, too, he was to recall long
after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. Er&mdash;thanks a heap! You&rsquo;ve
helped me no end,&rdquo; the boy said at last. &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
And he was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny, as he walked slowly
down the boulevard and across the river, &ldquo;is
one queer chap. He&rsquo;s up to something, I&rsquo;ll be
bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, if he wasn&rsquo;t on the up and up,
&lsquo;The Ferret&rsquo; would never have introduced him
to me. And then again, I wonder if &lsquo;The Ferret&rsquo;
ever makes a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE FACE IN THE NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson possessed a robust
body. Proper food, plenty of sleep, plain
living and clean thinking had kept it so. Few
there are who could have endured his harrowing
experience in the tunnel without a prolonged
visit to the hospital.</p>
<p>Johnny did not entirely escape. On the second
day following, a low fever set in. His
doctor ordered him to bed until the fever abated.
It lasted for an entire week. Such a week,
for a person endowed with a boundless supply
of nervous energy, was a great trial.</p>
<p>It did, however, give him time for thinking.
And his thoughts were long, long thoughts.</p>
<p>Often he found them returning to the youth
with the burning eyes. Over and over again
he seemed to hear him say: &ldquo;It is time for
some who are honest, good and clean to die.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Curiously enough, it was while listening to
the Voice, which came on exactly at ten
o&rsquo;clock each evening, that he thought oftenest
of those words. There was something about
the earnest tones of that mysterious unknown
voice that reminded him of the nameless one.
&ldquo;And may he not be the same person?&rdquo; he
asked himself one night.</p>
<p>But when he thought of it more soberly, the
thing seemed absurd. &ldquo;In a city of millions,
how could it be?&rdquo; he asked himself. Then he
dismissed the matter from his mind.</p>
<p>There were other matters requiring consideration.
And these made him restless, impatient
to be up and away. Some of his friends
were in trouble. Curlie Carson had opened a
registered mail sack; had made himself liable
to arrest; might even yet be arrested and
thrown into prison by the Federal authorities
if the priceless package were not found and
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is it to be found?&rdquo; he asked himself.
&ldquo;Find the man who took it and make
him confess, to be sure. How simple!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Strangely enough, while Johnny was still
confined to his bed and might well have been
thinking of this very matter, Grace Palmer received
a letter which for a time puzzled her
greatly.</p>
<p>Addressed to her at her home, it contained
the simple statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The man you are looking for will be at the
turn of the breakwater on the island at ten
o&rsquo;clock P. M., Wednesday, this week.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The note, which was unsigned, reached her
on Tuesday. She racked her mind for its meaning.
She had often gone to this man-made
island, but never in search of a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except&mdash;&rdquo; Her heart beat double time.
&ldquo;Except on that night with the young Air
Mail pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to the phone and got Curlie on the
wire. She told him of the note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a chance,&rdquo; he said, growing quite excited.
&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She did not hesitate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring
father&rsquo;s gun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gun? Oh, certainly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she supplemented, &ldquo;I am really
a good shot. And we may need it.&rdquo; They had
reason later to regret not having used it on
the offensive instead of on the defensive as
they had feared they might be obliged to do.</p>
<p>They went to the island half an hour early.
In a narrow space, just wide enough to afford
them a place of concealment, jammed between
two huge squares of limestone with another as
their resting place and a fourth forming a sort
of fortification before them, they waited while
Curlie&rsquo;s watch ticked the half hour away.</p>
<p>The night was chill. There was no moon.
For all that, a sort of half light reflected from
the city&rsquo;s street lights made it possible for
them to see a moving object at some distance.</p>
<p>At exactly the hour of ten an object appeared
on the narrow stretch of sand that lay
beyond the breakwater.</p>
<p>From Curlie&rsquo;s position it was impossible for
him to tell whether it was a man or some
prowling dog. He believed it to be a dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>The girl had placed a big, blue, long-barreled
revolver on the rocks before them. The manner
in which her nervous fingers gripped it,
together with the rapid beating of her heart
which he could feel through her shoulder
pressed against his own, told him plainer than
words that she believed it to be a man.</p>
<p>Some twenty feet of tumbled rocks lay between
them and the sand. Having crossed the
sand, the figure proceeded to clamber over the
rocks. They lay directly in his path. Curlie
drew in a long breath. With her free hand,
the girl gripped his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not really afraid,&rdquo; he told himself in
some surprise. &ldquo;A college girl, a professor&rsquo;s
daughter, too, and a real sport!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was little time for further thought.
The man, if man it was, was coming fast. Now
he had covered a quarter of the distance, now
half. Now&mdash;</p>
<p>Curlie&rsquo;s lips were formed for the word,
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; when one of those curious bits of circumstance
which so often bring our lives to
an abrupt turn, came to pass. The searchlight
from some boat out on the lake played
for just a fraction of a second on the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>In that split second Curlie saw that the figure
was that of a man; saw, too, that he was
short and round shouldered, that his hair was
curly and that his left ear was entirely missing.</p>
<p>So much for well trained eyes. No man may
hope to be an Air Mail pilot unless he possesses
such eyes.</p>
<p>A split second, then the light was gone. But
what was far more startling, the figure, too,
was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s not there!&rdquo; the girl whispered.</p>
<p>Curlie placed his hand gently over her
mouth.</p>
<p>For five full minutes, with the girl&rsquo;s vibrant
shoulder against his own, he lay motionless.
When he spoke it was still in a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep the place covered with the gun.
I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going over the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment her hand on his arm held
him back. When her grip relaxed, he went
over&mdash;and found not a trace of the man!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We had him
in our power. Now he is gone. We should
have covered him and made him surrender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;we should have. But
who would have thought he would disappear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The light. I know. By the way,&rdquo; he
chuckled, &ldquo;what did we mean to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. What? But was he the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he was, what could he be doing
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check,&rdquo; said Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wrote that letter, and why?&rdquo; she
asked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Double check,&rdquo; Curlie laughed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that was the man who took
the package?&rdquo; Grace Palmer asked as they
rode home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it may have been. I didn&rsquo;t see his
face clearly. It was too dark that morning.
But his figure was much the same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;You had better tell your friend, Johnny
Thompson, about this. Describe him. His ear
was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut clean off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie did tell Johnny. Johnny told some
one else, and something worth while came
of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A VISIT FROM &ldquo;THE FERRET&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Johnny did not lack friends. Those who
visited him during his brief illness were an
interesting lot.</p>
<p>On the third night, just after darkness had
fallen, &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; appeared. With him was
the nameless youth, he of the burning eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; seemed nervous and ill at
ease. Johnny thought this strange; it was not
at all like him. In the light of what took place
later it was not to seem so strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This lad,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; explained, walking
the floor the while, &ldquo;wants to know more
about the city, about men who break the law,
and those who are appointed to defend her
honest citizens. Particularly he wants to
know more about your friends, Drew Lane
and Tom Howe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>There was no subject closer to Johnny&rsquo;s
heart than the valor of his two young detective
friends. So, while &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; slowly paced
the floor, he filled the ears of the eager youth
with tales of their daring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There!&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; exclaimed at
last. &ldquo;You have told him enough. Knew too
much before. You&rsquo;ll get him killed. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth shot him a look, and there the
conversation ended. The extraordinary pair
left soon after. Alone with his thoughts,
Johnny meditated upon many matters of more
or less importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;an indefinable
relationship between those two. It is as if
they had known each other always, but never
too well; and yet as if an unbreakable bond
linked them together for life. It is strange,
for &lsquo;The Ferret&rsquo; is a middle aged man; the
other only a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night he listened as always to the mysterious
Voice of the air.</p>
<p>This night that earnest Voice made his remarks
more sweeping, more pointed and
scathing than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;This city is filled with traitors. And some
are traitors who know it not.&rdquo; Thus the voice
of the unknown one rang out into the night,
and a hundred thousand, listening, thrilled
they knew not why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When an officer of the law,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;accepts money from a bootlegger, a gambler
or any other law breaker, he is a traitor to the
city he has sworn to serve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But these are not the only traitors.&rdquo; The
voice of the speaker was tense with emotion.
&ldquo;Everything goes out over the air.&rdquo; This is
a slogan of radio workers everywhere. Something
was going out this night, memorable
words that would not be forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are rich traitors,&rdquo; the Voice went
on. &ldquo;When a rich man pays large sums to
crooked politicians so that his taxes on his
vast holdings may be reduced, he is a traitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are poor traitors, thousands of
them. You may be one. If you have paid
some one in your ward ten or twenty or forty
dollars to have your taxes reduced, you, too,
are a traitor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;If taxes are unjust, fight them. Fight them
in the courts. If the courts fail you, rise up
and fight with rifles and machine guns. But
never, never stoop to corruption to betray the
city you should love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were hard words. They were spoken
in a tone that told of an earnest desire to
serve. There were those listening who found
themselves repeating those words of a great
Master:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killeth
the prophets and stoneth them which are sent
unto thee, how often would I have gathered
thy children together even as a hen gathereth
her chickens under her wings, and ye would
not.&rdquo; These said, &ldquo;This city is no different
from Jerusalem. This young prophet, too, will
be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many there were who became very angry.
Rich men and poor men, politicians and
crooks, were together in this one thing: they
had been called traitors. And traitor is a hard
word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>The telephone of that radio station rang
again and again that night. Angry voices,
sympathetic voices, voices filled with a consuming
curiosity, were at the other end of the
lines. One and all, they asked the same question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this Voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To them all came the same answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not know. We know no more about
the Voice than you do,&rdquo; the announcer patiently
explained. &ldquo;He comes to us by remote
control. We throw in a switch, and his voice
is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he in this city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not know. Perhaps he is not human
at all, but only a voice from another world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words had their effect. There were
some who at heart had meant to be honest.
These put their receivers down softly and
went into conference with their own hearts.
Some made high resolves.</p>
<p>There were those, too, whose hearts were
as stone, whose whole beings were filled with
hate and greed. These slammed down the receivers
and vowed revenge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>But what revenge, and how? How did one
punish a voice?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow will get himself killed,&rdquo; was
Johnny&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;And what a pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were honest folk who thought the
words of this young prophet too harsh. There
were those who hoped for a regeneration of
their city. There were those who despaired.
And there were all too many who asked for
nothing so loudly as they did for the silencing
of this mysterious Voice, which was, they
averred, worse than an accusing conscience.</p>
<p>On this particular night the Voice went
from these broad statements to specific cases.
He told of many honest and sincere servants
of the people who had endeavored to do their
full duty; told also how they had been crowded
back into places of little or no importance.</p>
<p>He spoke of police officers sent to the
&ldquo;sticks&rdquo; because of their sincere attempts to
enforce the law.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>He came at last to the case of Drew Lane
and Tom Howe. By this time one of the great
newspapers of the city had taken up the fight.
It had devoted two full columns to their defense.
The Voice spoke of this, and then
launched upon a recital of their many acts of
danger and daring.</p>
<p>As Johnny listened his cheeks burned.
Twice he clapped his hands and shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Great! Great! Go to it, old top!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But again he grew very sober. How could
this Voice know all these facts? There was
something very intimate and personal about
it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps &lsquo;The Ferret&rsquo; told him,&rdquo; he murmured.
And then a thought struck him.
&ldquo;What if he is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish. The thing seemed quite
improbable. But if it were true, how had &ldquo;The
Ferret&rdquo; happened upon him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange fellow, that Ferret!&rdquo; he said to
himself aloud. &ldquo;Always has plenty of money,
yet he does not appear to be employed by
anyone. They say he is rich, or has a rich
friend. Who knows? Perhaps both statements
are true. Of one thing I am sure. He
is sincere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SHADOW PASSES</span></h2>
<p>On the fifth day the doctor granted Johnny
permission to dress and move about his
room. But under no circumstances was he to
&ldquo;leave the room or transact important business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I had important business to transact!&rdquo;
Johnny laughed to himself.</p>
<p>For all that, he sat a long time in a brown
study. There are times for all of us when we
appear to feel the shadows of tremendous
events hanging over us. It was so now with
Johnny. For some time he had been on the
trail of something big. His old pal, Curlie,
was under the shadows. He had broken the
postal regulations; had opened a registered
mail sack and had removed three valuable
packages. One package, perhaps the most
valuable of all, was missing. Until this was
found, Federal operators would dog his trail.
In time he might lose his position and his
standing as a pilot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>Closely connected with this, as it seemed
to Johnny, was the disgrace and shelving of
Drew Lane and Tom Howe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could find that man who lost
an ear, the one Curlie and that girl saw,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;If we could get him to talk;
if we could bring him and Greasy Thumb with
all his gang into court, we&rsquo;d show some people
up!&rdquo; Without really meaning to, he
thought of the Chief and of that whispering
reporter from <i>The World</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in time we will get that man!&rdquo; he told
himself with conviction. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find the crown
jewels of Russia, if that is what the package
truly contained. That will clear Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when certain people are properly
shown up, there will be a new deal all around.
Then Drew and Tom will be happy again.
They will be back downtown, close on the
heels of every crook who dares to show his
face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>He was still thinking of these coming events
which appeared to cast their shadows before
them, when the regular evening shadows began
to fall.</p>
<p>It was at this hour that one who was very
welcome indeed darkened the door of the
shack and said, after a low bow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need never ask,&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed,
as he recognized the caller. &ldquo;The latch string
is always out and the door stands always ajar
for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Joyce Mills. She took a seat in silence.
For fully five minutes neither spoke.
Silence is the test of true friendship. A superficial
friendship is often filled with much
clatter and many words without meaning.
Only the tightest, truest bond of friendship
grows stronger during a long period of eloquent
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; the girl spoke at last, &ldquo;I miss my
father terribly. Where can he have gone?
Why can&rsquo;t you find him for me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; Johnny leaned forward
with a smile. &ldquo;You find the man who stole
a registered package from Curlie Carson, and
I will find your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; The girl put out a slim hand.
Johnny gripped it hard.</p>
<p>Newton Mills, this girl&rsquo;s father, as you probably
know, had for many years been one of
New York&rsquo;s best known city detectives. The
life of such a man is hard. To catch criminals
it is necessary to live the life they live, or so it
has always been believed. This means long
hours in dark and doubtful places at night.
At times it means drinking and even drugs.
The life had demoralized Newton Mills at last.</p>
<p>Johnny had found him a derelict. He had
pulled this derelict to port and had for a time
at least rendered it seaworthy. Newton Mills
had once more worked wonders.</p>
<p>Now he was gone. He had vanished one
fine morning without word or sign. That had
been many days ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>As he sat there now with Joyce Mills, the
great detective&rsquo;s capable daughter, so near
him, Johnny thought of the times they had
enjoyed together. Kindred spirits they had
been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must find him!&rdquo; he said, thinking aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Johnny, you must!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s tone
carried an appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me.&rdquo; She brightened. &ldquo;What sort
of a man am I to look for&mdash;this one who
snatched the registered package?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man? Why, somehow Curlie&rsquo;s got
the notion that he&rsquo;s rather short and round
shouldered, with curly hair and one ear missing.
Queer business, that ear. Uncommon,
I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; the girl replied quite calmly.
&ldquo;Lost it trying to hold some one up, I believe.
The man resisted. This holdup fellow was
pushed off. The car started. He was caught
in the fender and dragged a long way. Tore
his ear right off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny stared at her in astonishment. &ldquo;So
he&rsquo;s a friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she added thoughtfully, &ldquo;it
may not be the same man. Not likely to be
two men like that in the world, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Johnny.&rdquo; She leaned forward eagerly.
&ldquo;If I find him I can make him talk!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not know it, but every truly
great detective holds certain men absolutely
within his power. Newton Mills, my father,
was a great detective. This man with but one
ear is a man who fears him more than death.
And I am the daughter of Newton Mills. It
is only necessary that I whisper in his one
good ear, and every secret of your old friend
Greasy Thumb, yes, and of your whispering
reporter and your Chief of uncertain character,
will lie before you like an open book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Johnny, I will find him!&rdquo; She rose to
go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More power to you!&rdquo; Johnny, too, stood
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Johnny!&rdquo; A sudden thought seized
her. &ldquo;That was not the man who set off the
bomb in the tunnel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;That was quite another
person, a wild-eyed man with tangled
hair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; laughed the girl, &ldquo;is next to no description
at all. I know a hundred such.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, who knows but that these
radicals lost their faith in the postal service at
the last moment and decided to take matters
in their own hands? Who will say that they
might not have hired an airplane that night to
bring Curlie down? There are plenty for hire.
I am told that big crooks leave the city often
in airplanes. Who knows but that it was their
man who trailed Curlie and took the package
from him? His identification of the man is far
from complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is the note to Grace Palmer saying
that the one-eared man is the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might not mean a thing. You have no notion
of the length those crooked ones will go
in order to cast suspicion on one enemy or
throw another off the track. Perhaps in this
case they feel they have succeeded in doing
both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me a few days ago that you had
been mixing a little with the radicals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Believe in their stuff?&rdquo; Johnny asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They can&rsquo;t think straight. No use
following people like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re still in good standing with
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not keep an eye on that angle
of the case? Go to a meeting. Listen to their
talk. They may let something slip. If one
of their members took the package from Curlie,
you may find it out. If they did not get
the package there will be more and more of a
row about it, I&rsquo;d say. They should be like a
nest of disturbed bumble-bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good hunch. I&rsquo;ll follow it up. I&rsquo;ll
get your man, be it one or the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Johnny,&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s tones became almost
solemn as her thoughts returned to her
missing father, &ldquo;you must not forget your
share of the contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not forget. For the sake of Newton
Mills and his wonderful daughter, I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>The girl flushed. Nevertheless, she put out
a hand, and they entered into a handclasp that
was the seal of a pledge.</p>
<p>Then the tall, slim, dark-eyed daughter of
Newton Mills, keen as a razor and hard as
steel, marched down one rickety stairway and
up another, and was gone.</p>
<p>Half an hour later it was quite dark. Johnny
as he sat there alone with no lights, thought
he heard those rude stairways creak. Creeping
noiselessly to the window, he looked out.
The light was very uncertain. But through
the shadows he saw a tall figure, dressed all
in gray, pass up one stairway and down the
other. This the figure repeated twice, then
vanished into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gray Shadow passes,&rdquo; Johnny murmured,
then shuddered, he knew not why.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE RISING TIDE OF ANGER</span></h2>
<p>Each night found the Voice at the microphone.
Ever faithful to the task set before
him, he denounced in no uncertain tones
the ways of a city too long sold body and
soul to vice and corruption.</p>
<p>Night after night the station phone rang,
and angry people demanded to know who this
Voice was. The answer was ever the same:
&ldquo;No one about the station knows the answer
to that question. This is a regularly incorporated
station. Our business is that of selling
time on the air. This hour has been paid
for. We are not permitted to tell who pays for
this time. The broadcast comes in by remote
control. We have no notion where the speaker
may be reached.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>So, night after night, perhaps from some
small and dingy office, perhaps from a hall
bedroom or the study of a palatial home, the
Voice sent his message out to the listening
world.</p>
<p>And the world did listen. Thousands of letters
poured in. Many commended the speaker.
Some were sharp in their condemnation. But
the Voice never faltered.</p>
<p>Strange men were at times found prowling
about the station. Wires were cut and tapped.
Some one with power behind him was conducting
a thorough search for the mysterious
prophet of the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they find him!&rdquo; Johnny said to himself,
and shuddered.</p>
<p>The day came when Johnny was able to go
about his business once more. And on that
day Curlie visited the shack.</p>
<p>For some time the two boys talked of other
days and the adventures that had brought joy
and sorrow, thrills and terror to them both.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>When at last the conversation turned to the
future, Curlie&rsquo;s face fell. Many days had
passed. No trace of the missing package had
been found. The city police were optimistic.
They were following clews. The hard-headed
Federal men were quite the reverse. They had
made no noteworthy discoveries and, as time
passed, had grown cross and surly about the
whole affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go on again to-morrow.&rdquo; There was
more than a touch of gloom in Curlie&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;Take the mail to New York. Hope it&rsquo;s a fine
day for flying. May be my last trip. The company&rsquo;s
been fine about it; truly sporting. But
if the Federal men demand my dismissal I&rsquo;ll
have to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And think what it means to leave the air!&rdquo;
He grew suddenly eloquent. &ldquo;Up with the
dawn. The cool damp of night still all about
you. Leaping away into the clouds that are
all red and gold with the dawn. Sweeping
over broad stretches of green and brown and
gray, of the dull, slow-going earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And again to do battle with wind and rain,
lightning, sleet and hail. To soar aloft above
it all; to glory in wings, in flight; to be a bird,
a bloomin&rsquo; wild duck, free as the air!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then to think,&rdquo; his tone changed, &ldquo;to
think of leaving it all for this dull, dusty earth
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Johnny, springing to his
feet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get that man, yes, and the jewels
with him! You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps Curlie&rsquo;s description of flying made
the room seem stuffy. At least Johnny threw
up a window. The stiff north wind entering
at his bidding, caught a bit of paper and sent
it fluttering to the floor. Another and yet another
followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Curlie leaned over to pick up
the first one. &ldquo;Money! A twenty, a ten and
another twenty. And here comes a five. Why,
man! You&rsquo;re lousy with money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny rather soberly, &ldquo;is
marked money. I&rsquo;ve not quite decided what
to do with it. There&rsquo;s something over a hundred
and fifty dollars in all. When I was
washed out of the tunnel, or carried out by
some mysterious being, the roll got soggy wet.
I put it up on the shelf there to dry and forgot
it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen. I&rsquo;ll tell you about it. Then you
tell me what to do. I&rsquo;d thought about giving
part of it to that truck farmer who gambled
and lost, but I&rsquo;ll follow your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Johnny had finished the story of his
adventures on the carnival grounds, Curlie sat
for a time in a brown study. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he
said at last, &ldquo;you could give it back to that
gambling truck farmer, if you succeeded in
finding him. Fine chance, though. May have
come twenty miles to that carnival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, what&rsquo;s the good? The poor goof
would just throw up his hands and shout:
&lsquo;Boy, I&rsquo;m lucky! I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m lucky!&rsquo; Then
he&rsquo;d go somewhere else and lose it gambling.
The real gambling habit is an incurable disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand&mdash;&rdquo; His face lit up with
a kindly smile. &ldquo;I know another farmer who
never gambles, except as everyone does who
plants a crop. He has a little girl, a cripple;
but the cutest, most cheerful cripple in the
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know&mdash;the one I was going to send
a doll and doll buggy by parachute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; He sprang to his feet. &ldquo;If
you really must get rid of that money, give it
to them. They need it. Crops have been bad;
burned out. I&rsquo;ll take you along in the plane
and drop you off in a parachute, you and the
money, just as I planned to throw over the
doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby you will!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was
doubtful. &ldquo;How far do you drop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far as you like, two thousand, three, five,
ten thousand feet. It&rsquo;s all the same to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And he probably was dead long before he
touched the ground.&rsquo;&rdquo; Johnny groaned as he
quoted an oft repeated expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Curlie in disgust, &ldquo;is all rot!
I&rsquo;ve dropped eight thousand feet straight
down, then opened my parachute. Felt fine
all the way down. Breath normal, hearing,
eyesight, everything just as now. I tell you it
was swell! Like diving off a high board into
water, only there was no splash, and no chill.
You don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m offering you. It
will give you a fresh glimpse of life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added after a moment, &ldquo;you
have been hanging around this dirty, noisy,
crime-ridden city too long. You need a glimpse
of the way life may be lived in plain comfort
and peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was more talk and still more explaining.
But in the end it was agreed that Johnny
was to accompany Curlie on his flight and
that, weather permitting, there should be a
parachute jump with Johnny in the harness
the very next day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CREAKING STAIRS</span></h2>
<p>The cackling of geese saved Rome. A
spider by his patience once gave the immortal
Bruce the courage needed to win a
great victory. Even a mouse may cause a deal
of disturbance; Joyce Mills was to discover
this on the very night that Johnny and Curlie
sat planning their flight.</p>
<p>That night she visited the camp of the Bolsheviks.
In spite of all that Johnny had said,
she still believed that these radicals who were
bent on destroying the present form of government
in America had robbed the Air Mail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are shrewd people,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;They have members, yes, and spies, in every
corner of our land. They were expecting the
package. The American Secret Service men
learned of its arrival. They had planned to
seize it the moment it arrived in this city.
What was to hinder the radical spies from
finding out that the Secret Service men were
after their Russian Crown jewels? What more
natural than that they make a bold attempt to
re-take the jewels before it was too late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus she reasoned as she made her way
alone down the city street that led to the radical
center.</p>
<p>As she neared the place she shuddered a little.
She had attended many of these meetings,
and yet the thought of them always affected
her in the same way. &ldquo;As if I had seen a snake
in the grass,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>The building occupied by this radical group
was long and low. A one-storied structure,
it ran the length of the block, but extended
back from the street only about sixty feet.</p>
<p>During a great fair there had been many
small shops there. After the fair, the store-rooms
had been transformed into cheap studios.
Here musicians of a sort and artists who
painted futuristic daubs and other strange distortions
of art lived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>In one of these buildings lived Brother
Krosky. It was in his studio that the brethren
of his set met.</p>
<p>His studio was divided into two rooms, a
large front room and a very secret back room.
Besides these, there was a cubbyhole of a place
where one prepared a meal.</p>
<p>Many times Joyce Mills had been admitted
to the front room. There, in uncomfortable
chairs, over very weak tea, all sorts of people,
young students with bright, simple faces, old
artists with long hair, middle-aged women
with clicking false teeth, and many others
mouthed big words and looking wise as owls
proceeded to solve all the problems of a great
nation at a single sitting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>They had interested Joyce a little and had
often amused her. But now she was in deadly
earnest. She had never been in that secret
back room. To-night, whether invited or not,
she meant to go in. For to this room, she
knew right well, a certain little group of
dark and gloomy-faced individuals including
Brother Krosky retired at a rather late hour
to discuss matters of weight and importance.
The subjects talked of so freely in the outer
room were of a general nature, the discussions
rather vague. She guessed that in the back
room all high sounding talk ceased and the
brethren &ldquo;got down to brass tacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the package of jewels is still missing
from their treasure house, there is sure to be
some discussion regarding it. And that is exactly
what I want to hear,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>So, when the hour had grown late and the
tea very thin indeed, she seized upon a moment
when a certain brother held the others spellbound
with his eloquent discussion of the
rights of the proletariat, to slip through the
door into the secret chamber. She was more
than a little frightened at first. The place was
completely dark. How was she to find a place
of hiding?</p>
<p>Fortune favored her, for almost at once her
hand came into contact with a long davenport.
At once she dropped on her knees to feel beneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just room,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Glad I&rsquo;m thin
as a rail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>Ten seconds later found her flat on her
stomach beneath that davenport, waiting patiently
for secret matters to transpire.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>At this same hour a plainly dressed youth
was preparing to enter a dingy brick building
in an unlovely section of the great city. With
his hand on the knob, he glanced right and
left. As if apprehensive of being followed, he
lingered on the threshold.</p>
<p>Seeing no one, he disappeared quickly within.
At once there came the sound of a key being
turned in a lock.</p>
<p>This ceremony performed, he proceeded in
a leisurely manner up seven flights of grimy,
unscrubbed wooden stairs to a small room beneath
the eaves.</p>
<p>This youth was none other than the one of
the burning eyes&mdash;the one who, having been
introduced to Johnny Thompson by &ldquo;The Ferret,&rdquo;
had taken him for an eight mile walk
with no apparent reason except that he wished
Johnny to know that hundreds of thousands
of honest people lived in the city. To-night
his eyes appeared to shine in the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>That he had reason for apprehension on this
particular night might easily have been discovered
by anyone who chanced to linger near
that street doorway. Hardly had the boy&rsquo;s
footsteps died away than a short, dark individual,
whose features were all but hidden by a
turned-up collar and a pulled down cap, moved
stealthily toward the same door.</p>
<p>Having applied an ear to the keyhole, he
remained motionless for the space of sixty
seconds. After that he tried the door. Finding
it locked, he produced a prodigious bunch
of keys. He studied them critically for a moment,
and then selecting three, applied the
first of them to the keyhole.</p>
<p>With a grunt of disapproval, he discarded
this to try the second. No better result. The
third did the trick. The lock clicked, the door
swung open. More silent than a mouse, the
man slipped inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;it is the third
one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Sitting down on the first step he removed
his shoes. Having tied the strings together,
he threw them over his shoulder. After that,
with no sound at all save the occasional creak
of a board that roused him to silent profanity,
he ascended the seven flights of stairs.</p>
<p>Arrived at the last landing, he paused to
listen. Like those of certain wild animals, his
ears appeared to rise to the sound that came
from within.</p>
<p>Some one was talking; yet, when the youth
had entered he had found no one there. The
room had no other entrance. No words could
be distinguished. Still, by the manner in
which the speaker went steadily, endlessly on
and on, one might have judged that he was
deeply in earnest.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Spy&rdquo;&mdash;for such was the name given
to him long ago by the underworld&mdash;listened
at the keyhole but for a single moment. Then,
cocking his head on one side, he twisted his
face into a smile that was a horrible thing to
see and uttered a sound half aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh! Uh huh!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>The sound coming through his nose resembled
nothing quite so much as the grunt of a
satisfied pig. He repeated it once again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning, he crept noiselessly down the
stairs.</p>
<p>At the first landing he paused to rub his
hands and mutter aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five grand! Five thousand dollars. And
so easy. So easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if the thing pleased him immensely, he
paused at each landing to repeat this little
ceremony, which in the darkness resembled
an obeisance to some ancient god of evil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>The &ldquo;Spy&rdquo; belonged to the underworld. He
was by nature a spy. Never in his whole life
had he committed a crime, as we think of
crimes. He had never snatched a purse,
robbed a safe, nor held a man up on the street.
Yet he had assisted in many such events, and
always for pay. The &ldquo;Spy&rdquo; had but one god.
That was money. He had but one talent; that
was for spying. He never sold his services
to the city or the State. All his life he had
worked for evil doers. When a bank was to
be robbed, the &ldquo;Spy&rdquo; looked into all such matters
as burglar alarms, late working clerks
and watchmen. It was the same with a payroll
holdup. He smoothed the way. And always,
as I have said, for pay.</p>
<p>The creatures of the underworld did not
love him. They hated and despised him; yet,
because of his art of spying, they used him.
The officers of the law feared and hated him.
Gladly would they have flung him into jail.
But until now they had found no charge
against him.</p>
<p>Now, as it would seem, he was embarked
upon an enterprise of no inconsiderable importance.
His fee was to be five thousand
dollars. A tidy sum. A year&rsquo;s pay for a bright
and capable man. Yet, by the mere climbing
of seven flights of stairs he considered it
earned.</p>
<p>There are times when that which seems
earned is not really earned at all. By labor and
pain man earns his bread. In this case, as we
shall see, the pain outweighed the labor.</p>

<h2 id="c28"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TWO ANKLES AND A SCREAM</span></h2>
<p>Joyce Mills waited long in her uncomfortable
place beneath the long davenport
in the secret chamber of Brother Krosky.
Some very open-mouthed and big-eyed students
from a near-by university were eager
to hear a certain brother direct from Russia
tell his philosophy of life, and he was quite as
eager to talk. So the slim, muscular, nervous
girl beneath the davenport eased her cramped
muscles and steadied her jumpy nerves as best
she could and patiently awaited events.</p>
<p>At last Brother Krosky closed the front
door behind the last student, and accompanied
by four ponderous gentlemen and two equally
ponderous women, retired to the back room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>Joyce fairly held her breath as they entered.
There was, however, little need for that.
Brother Krosky produced a dark bottle which
decidedly did not contain weak tea. There
was a clinking of glasses, and after that a
babble of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That black bottle loosed their tongues,&rdquo;
the girl thought with an inward groan. &ldquo;Now
it will be another hour before they settle down
to business. By that time I&rsquo;ll be so like a
mummy that I shan&rsquo;t be able to move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Move? A thought struck her squarely. How
was she to get out of this place, anyway? How
did she know the brothers wouldn&rsquo;t sleep in
this very room?</p>
<p>Had there been some little black imp about
he would doubtless have whispered in her ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no imp about. But a creature
much more real was. Suddenly she felt something
touch her ankle. With great difficulty
she held perfectly still and did not utter a
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; She shuddered.</p>
<p>Her nerves steadied again. &ldquo;Old imagination
at work again,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Too
much tea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>To get her mind away from unpleasant speculations,
she fixed her thoughts on her surroundings.
Before her, easily within reach,
were two pairs of fat ankles. The women of
the party had chosen the davenport as their
seat.</p>
<p>From the way the shadows flickered, she
guessed that candles were being used to give
the place &ldquo;atmosphere.&rdquo; From the position of
these shadows on the floor, she guessed that
the candles rested on a small table directly
before the worthy ladies.</p>
<p>Little did she dream how these facts were
to serve her later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen!&rdquo; Brother Krosky
beat on the table with his fist. &ldquo;We have gathered
here to discuss matters of grave importance.&rdquo;
A hush fell over the room. He rose
heavily, crossed the floor unsteadily and closed
and locked the outer door.</p>
<p>Joyce felt her heart sink. The trap was
growing tighter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he began again,
&ldquo;on the twentieth of last month there left Moscow
a very precious package. The Third International
expected great things from this priceless
package.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur, half assent, half admiration, followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It arrived in New York. It left New York
two days later. Sent by a trusted brother, it
was insured for one thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more a murmur.</p>
<p>Joyce was listening breathlessly. Her
nerves were also at work. They reported that
some moving object, like the priceless package,
was making progress. Starting at her
ankle, it had passed up to her knee, then to
her thigh. It had made a successful passage
over the rocky ridge that was her spinal column.</p>
<p>She had guessed what this creature was.
All her life, from the time of faintest recollection,
she had feared a mouse. Gangsters,
thieves, hoodlums of all sorts, held no terror
for her. But a mouse! The blood was frozen
in her veins. She was a mummy indeed. But
not quite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; the sonorous voice
of Brother Krosky continued, &ldquo;that package
began its journey to this city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, at last, here was the story! But no. At
this instant there came an audible gasp.</p>
<p>The ladies stared. The gentlemen stared.
Krosky stared. Whence had come that sound!</p>
<p>Joyce could have told them. It had come
from her lips. The mouse had leaped from her
shoulder to her ear. That she could not stand.</p>
<p>She knew what the result would be: a
search. A search! And then? There must be
no search.</p>
<p>She was a person of action. Those tempting
fat ankles were still before her. In front
of them were the table and the candles.</p>
<p>Timing herself exactly, she seized an ankle
in each hand and screamed.</p>
<p>The result was more than she had expected.
The ladies screamed and plunged headlong.
The table went over. The davenport went
over. The candles went out. And in the darkness
that followed, Joyce unlocked the door
and vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>Ten minutes later found her quietly strolling
down a path in the park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is astonishing how still a place like this
can be at night,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what rotten luck I&rsquo;ve had!&rdquo; she exclaimed
a moment later. &ldquo;All that fuss and I
really found out nothing. I wonder what
earthly use a mouse could be put to anyway?
If I knew of any I&rsquo;d buy half a dozen white
ones and put them to work, just for revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>If you have read much in the ancient writings
you will recall the story of the wilderness
prophet who lived on locusts and wild honey.
You will remember, too, that when he was
asked who he was, he replied: &ldquo;I am the voice
of one crying in the wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A queen heard of that voice and became very
angry because of its utterances. Which all
goes to prove that even in those days, a voice
had influence and power. How much more so
to-day, when a voice on the air, sounding over
thousands of miles, spans oceans, continents,
and speaks to millions!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>The Voice, with which Johnny had become
so familiar, continued its nightly messages to
the people of the great city. And with each
passing night the anger of some, the approval
of many, grew. It became no infrequent occurrence
for people to overhear on street car,
in shop, factory, or store, the words: &ldquo;Did you
hear him? Did you hear the Voice last night?
Isn&rsquo;t he grand? Doesn&rsquo;t he speak the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the enthusiasm of many. Many
there were, too, who attempted to discover
his identity; but all in vain.</p>
<p>Some there were, sober minded ones of long
experience, who shook their heads sadly and
murmured low:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He speaks truth. But it is rash. The world
has never loved its prophets. It stoned them
in olden times. What less can be expected to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all unheeding, the Voice went steadily,
fearlessly on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JOYCE FRAMES ONE</span></h2>
<p>For Johnny, the next day was one of experiences
both fantastic and thrilling. He
had ridden in an airplane many times. But a
parachute&mdash;that was something different. So,
too, was a glider. But Johnny was not the
one who rode in the glider.</p>
<p>They rose from the earth, those two good
pals, Johnny and Curlie, just as the sun was
putting the last golden touch to the fleecy
clouds of morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be grander!&rdquo; Johnny thought
to himself as they glided up&mdash;up&mdash;up until
they were in the very midst of a glowing mist.</p>
<p>They emerged to go skimming away toward
a larger, denser cloud that seemed a huge pillow
suspended on high.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we hit it,&rdquo; Johnny thought, &ldquo;it seems
that we must bury ourselves and be sent
bounding back like a rubber ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was, of course, only using his imagination.
He was not surprised in the least as
they passed through it, to emerge once more
into the glorious sunshine of a new day.</p>
<p>It was no time at all, however, before he
found himself suspecting that he had fallen
into a day dream from which he could not
awaken.</p>
<p>They were some time reaching the next
cloud. As they approached it he seemed to
see a dark object moving along its edge. At
first he thought this was a trick of the imagination.
As they came nearer, he was sure that
it was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How odd!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be a bird.
Too big. Can&rsquo;t be an airplane. Doesn&rsquo;t move
fast enough. Even if its motor were stopped
it would sink rapidly. But there it moves on
like a bird, soaring, soaring always. And we
must be all of five thousand feet up.&rdquo; He fairly
gasped with astonishment.</p>
<p>This was as nothing compared to what followed
shortly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>As they came rapidly nearer and Johnny
could make out a figure at the wheel, he concluded
that this was one of those new machines
that had recently come to be so much
the thing&mdash;a glider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But five thousand feet in the air!&rdquo; He was
truly astonished. &ldquo;Could only reach that
height by tying on to an airplane. And that&rsquo;s
forbidden. Too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A final shock was to follow. As they
neared the glider he recognized the figure
seated serenely there. A tall, gaunt figure it
was. A long gray coat was draped about its
body. A gray cap hid its eyes. Its gray beard
shone in the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gray Shadow!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>As if he had heard these words, which was
not possible, of course, with the thundering
of the motors, the lone glider turned his machine
directly about and at once lost himself
in the great white morning cloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; Johnny mused, as they went
thundering on their way. &ldquo;That person, or
spirit, or whatever he may be, appears to
haunt my path. I cannot escape him. On the
carnival grounds, in a tunnel, at the shack,
in the air, it is always the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after all,&rdquo; he philosophized, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
the use of wanting to escape him. No harm
has come from his presence. Good may yet
come. Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in this last he was more accurate than
he knew.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Joyce Mills had arrived at her room none
the worse for her experience with the sofa,
two pairs of fat ankles and a mouse.</p>
<p>She lay awake long that night, wondering
about the missing package, the brethren of
the radical cult, the man with the missing ear,
Johnny&rsquo;s Gray Shadow, the Voice of the air,
and many other more or less mysterious persons
and things.</p>
<p>For all this, she woke with the rising sun
ready for one more day at the store. And an
eventful day it was to be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>She punched the clock promptly at the hour
of nine, filled in the cards of her salesbook&mdash;which
was, as we have said, only a blind to
hide her real mission at the store&mdash;and then
stood waiting, as it seemed, for a customer,
but in reality with eyes wide open looking for
trouble.</p>
<p>This morning trouble came sooner than she
expected. But it was, you might say, trouble
of her own making.</p>
<p>She had wandered out of the book section
for a moment and drifted into the store&rsquo;s little
world of rare perfumes, when suddenly a man
caught her attention. He was leaning on a
counter, staring apparently at nothing. The
man had a familiar look. Where had she seen
him before? She racked her brain in vain.
She took a turn to the right for a better view.
Then, with the force of a blow, it came to
her. At this point she saw the other side of
the man&rsquo;s face. On this side there was no ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my man!&rdquo; she fairly hissed. &ldquo;But
how am I to get him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyce was a fast thinker. In a moment she
had formed a plan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>Before her on the counter stood a vial of
perfume. The price was, she knew, fifteen dollars.
The girl at the counter turned to wait
on a customer. In that instant the vial of
perfume vanished. So, too, did our young
lady detective. She brushed lightly past the
man who still leaned on the counter staring
at nothing.</p>
<p>When she returned a moment later a sturdy,
middle-aged man accompanied her&mdash;the first
assistant house detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he demanded in an undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perfume!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For his best girl. Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; Her
tone showed impatience. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in his left hand
coat pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective stepped up to the man leaning
on the counter. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he half apologized,
&ldquo;but we can&rsquo;t have this sort of thing!&rdquo;
He deftly extracted a vial of rare perfume
from the man&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>Turning his head about as if he had not
heard aright and staring at the bottle of perfume,
the man stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;do you think I&rsquo;d take that stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you would!&rdquo; Joyce Mills broke
in almost fiercely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d take anything. See
here, you!&rdquo; She fixed her burning black eyes
upon him. &ldquo;Do you remember Newton Mills,
the New York City detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shrank back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m his daughter! And he&rsquo;s here in
this city. Now, tell this gentleman again that
you wouldn&rsquo;t steal perfume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; the man with the missing
ear stammered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have him,&rdquo; Joyce Mills whispered
in the detective&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not the custom. You&rsquo;re only a
slip of a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have him,&rdquo; she insisted. Her voice
was filled with a fierce determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, mister,&rdquo; the other broke in.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with her. Give you my word of honor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your word of honor!&rdquo; scoffed the detective.
&ldquo;Oh, all right, take him,&rdquo; he said, turning to
Joyce. &ldquo;And take this,&rdquo; he slipped a small
revolver into her jacket pocket, &ldquo;and keep
your eyes open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My eyes and my ears.&rdquo; The girl actually
laughed as she marched away with her prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You framed me!&rdquo; the man grumbled, as
they reached the outer door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I framed you. But
there&rsquo;s a reason. You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know plenty. Come on! Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the store and lost themselves in
the throng that milled along the busiest street
in the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FROM OUT THE CLOUDS</span></h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson saw no more of
the mysterious Gray Shadow among the
clouds that morning. He was soon enough
to forget all about him, for fresh adventure
lay before him.</p>
<p>Hardly had they left the Shadow and his
cloud behind than he began thinking of his
promise to Curlie. He had agreed to drop
from the sky and to play the part of good
fairy to a crippled child.</p>
<p>Johnny was very fond of small children,
crippled children most of all. But as the plane
sped on high in the air, as they came nearer
and nearer to the place where Curlie must
turn and give him the signal to prepare for
the leap, he found himself wishing that the
sky lay close to the ground where one might
step off at any time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed at last, &ldquo;there must always
be a first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he groaned a moment later, &ldquo;if anything
goes wrong, the first is last and the last
is first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he began thinking of Curlie&rsquo;s instructions:
&ldquo;Walk out on the wing. Watch
your balance. Play you are on a diving board.
Make a dive. Count five. Pull the cord. The
parachute will do the rest. Only, when you
come close to the earth, see that your knees
are bent. Don&rsquo;t land stiff-legged. That&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buttoned inside of Johnny&rsquo;s jacket was a
doll. Wrapped about the doll was the marked
money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be through with
that money. They&rsquo;ll never suspect this trick
of ours. And they&rsquo;ll never find it. This is once
in my life when I do the Robin Hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had he thought this through than
Curlie turned his head about to nod. He held
up three fingers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three fingers. Three minutes!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s
mind went into a whirl. Three minutes of
sunshine and fleecy clouds. Three minutes
of glorious freedom and life. And after that?</p>
<p>He rose stiffly to his place. As he put out
a hand to steady himself it seemed that he
was stiff as a wooden soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; He got a grip on himself.
&ldquo;Gotta go through! Lots of fellows
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this he felt better. He moved carefully
a little way out on the wing, looked to the
straps about his body, allowed his eyes to circle
the sky; then, putting his hands together,
he made a perfect dive.</p>
<p>At once he was shocked because there was
no shock. He was going down. But what a
glorious sensation! Like real flying, a bird&rsquo;s
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One. Two. Three. Four. Five!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled the cord. More gliding downward.
A slight shock that told him the parachute
was open; then the earth came up to
meet him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>At first a blurred impression, it resolved itself
into fields and pastures, an orchard, a
farmhouse, and last of all, a small girl dressed
in red.</p>
<p>Johnny came down standing. He ran a few
steps. His parachute folded up. He lurched a
step or two, then stood still not thirty feet
from a very much surprised little girl who
fairly danced, in spite of her crutches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;I looked, and you were not there.
Then I looked again and you were. How
funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;it is strange. But then,
this is a strange world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came down from the air to bring you a
doll. Curlie sent it&mdash;Curlie Carson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curlie Carson! A doll!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;She shuts her eyes
when she sleeps. And she can talk a little.
But the best part is her dress. See! It is all
made of real money! There is another dress
underneath. So tell your daddy to take off
this green dress and use it buying things for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The little girl stared. She did not
understand all this. But she took the doll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father may not understand it either,&rdquo;
Johnny told himself. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll leave it that
way, at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, little girl. Have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gathered up his parachute and started
for the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going back into the air?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day. Some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He climbed over the fence, caught a ride on
a passing truck, and was gone.</p>
<p>That night there was surprise and great
rejoicing in the little unpainted farmhouse
that lay beneath the great Air Mail route to
New York. And many were the happy days
that followed.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that Greasy Thumb and
his gang never guessed the final disposition
of their ill-gotten gain&mdash;their marked money.</p>

<h2 id="c31"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TRAIL LEADS NORTH</span></h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson was back at the
shack in the city. Drew Lane and Tom
Howe were there. So too was &ldquo;The Ferret,&rdquo;
and two heavy-set Federal men. But the center
of attention was a certain slim miss in a
plain, dark gray suit&mdash;Joyce Mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the whole story,&rdquo; she said impressively,
as the last man to arrive drew up a
chair. &ldquo;The trail leads north to the woods and
lakes of Michigan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you where the loot is hidden?&rdquo;
It was a Federal man who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not, because he could not. He
didn&rsquo;t know. He gave the package to another
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyce Mills shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;How
should I know? In the city somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;You let him go!&rdquo; The Federal man&rsquo;s tone
held guarded scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. On his own word that he would not
leave the city, nor get in touch with those
in the north woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His word!&rdquo; The Federal man&rsquo;s scorn was
unveiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, his word!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s black eyes
flashed. &ldquo;And if you wish to use the information
I have, you will treat me as a lady should
be treated!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Federal man recoiled. For a moment
there was silence in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; The pompous Federal man unbent.
&ldquo;I apologize. Please go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man,&rdquo; Joyce Mills said slowly, &ldquo;the
one with one ear gone, was a stool pigeon for
my father. My father has things on him that
would send him to prison for years or get
him shot in twenty-four hours. He told me
the whole truth. He did not dare do otherwise.
The trail leads north. He does not know
where the package is. Those who do are up
there. We must get those men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>Those who listened knew well enough the
men she meant; knew, too, that they were
dangerous characters. Yet there was not one
of them who was not eager to follow her into
the forest. For now, at last, they felt themselves
close to the end of the trail. Not one
of them questioned this slim girl&rsquo;s statement
that she had, in a manner all her own, discovered
the whereabouts of the earless one
and obtained from him the full story of how
Curlie Carson was forced to earth in his Air
Mail plane and later robbed of his priceless
package. Drew Lane and Tom Howe would
be vindicated. They would have a new deal.
Curlie Carson&rsquo;s name would be cleared. The
city they loved would be freed from a dangerous
band of outlaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead on!&rdquo; Drew Lane&rsquo;s tone was impressive.
&ldquo;We will follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, one by one, with a slim girl in the lead,
they filed out of the shack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE PLACE OF RENDEZVOUS</span></h2>
<p>At an hour after darkness had fallen, had
you happened upon a certain rather large
cabin on a point of land where many islands
and this point form a bay on the shore of
Lake Huron, and had you chanced to look
through a crack in the rough board shutters,
you might have witnessed an impressive sight.</p>
<p>The room was large, twice as large as the
average living room. It was not ceiled. The
single fluttering candle formed grotesque
shadows among its rafters of round cedar
logs.</p>
<p>The place was devoid of furniture. In lieu
of a chair, the present occupants had brought
in from out of doors blocks of wood, an orange
crate and some nail kegs found on the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>Seated as they were in a half circle about
the candle, with revolvers strapped about
waists and rifles across knees, they looked
grim and determined.</p>
<p>There was Drew Lane with stiff hat still
on one side, and Tom Howe, silent as ever.
There was &ldquo;The Ferret,&rdquo; shrinking into the
darkest corner. There were the two over-stout
Federal men. There, too, was Johnny, eager
and expectant; and close beside him, as if
trusting him most of all, as in truth she did,
was Joyce Mills. So, for a time, they sat in
silence awaiting the zero hour. For directly
across the bay about half an hour&rsquo;s row, was
a hunting lodge which was to be the center
of their attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see this cabin?&rdquo; The voice of &ldquo;The
Ferret&rdquo; sounded strange, coming as it did
from his dark corner. There was no answer.
None was expected. &ldquo;It has seen much of life,
this cabin has. It has known life and death,
love and hate, fear and defiance. And now
comes the law to claim its humble protection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ragged old cabin; yet how many
homes have witnessed more of life than it has?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see those papers pasted close to
the peak? They are old. If you climbed up
there as I did when I was sort of looking
round up here a few weeks ago (I&rsquo;ve always
suspected that lodge over yonder), you&rsquo;d find
that they were printed thirty-five years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a homestead cabin, this. Old Heintz
Webber, a German, a stolid fellow, took up
land and brought a bright young bride here
to pine away with loneliness. She died when
the child came. He found a hard woman to
take her place. The two hard ones reared the
child in their hard way. And she came to hate
them both. So the cabin which had witnessed
death came to witness hate. When she was
seventeen she ran away with a man twice her
age; not because she loved him, but to get away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two hard ones sold out for a hard
price. Then the cabin was alone for a long
time. A very lonesome place it was, too. The
moon looked down over the fir trees as it
might over a graveyard. The wild deer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off short. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A curious sound reached their ears. &ldquo;Covey&mdash;covey&mdash;covey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only a porcupine talking to his mate,&rdquo;
Johnny chuckled, &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one day a young soldier back from
the war saw this place and came to love it
as he did the girl he meant to make his wife.
He built a rustic porch and covered it with
balsam boughs. He made a bed of cedar poles
and a table of white birch. And here for one
short month they lived, those two, the soldier
and his bride. The song-sparrow built his
nest in the balsam boughs over the porch and
sang them to sleep at night. The sound of
waves rushing on the shore mingled with their
dreams. The sun over the cedars awakened
them. And so this old cabin at last came to
witness true love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now!&rdquo; His tone changed. &ldquo;Now the
hour has come. The law must have its turn.
And may justice triumph. Come, gentlemen,
and you, Miss Joyce, we must be on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>This was the most dramatic moment in
Joyce Mills&rsquo; life. She had promised Johnny
that she would find the man who had snatched
the package from Curlie Carson on the dim-lit
streets of the city. She had made good.
Coming upon him in the very store in which
she worked, she had &ldquo;planted&rdquo; a bottle of
costly perfume on his person by slipping it in
his pocket. When she had caused his arrest
she had forced him, by telling him she was
Newton Mills&rsquo; daughter, to confess his part
in the affair that had thrown a shadow over
Curlie Carson&rsquo;s life and had placed Drew Lane
and Tom Howe practically in retirement.</p>
<p>The affair, he had confessed, had been pulled
off by Greasy Thumb, Three Fingers and their
gang. That gang was now hiding in the far
north woods. The priceless package was hidden,
he knew not where.</p>
<p>So now they were here at the dead of night,
prepared to march against an enemy whose
numbers they did not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Johnny whispered in her ear.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em! All bad men are cowards at
heart. We&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em, you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<h2 id="c33"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SHADOW FALLS</span></h2>
<p>As long as he lives, Johnny will not forget
that ride across the bay. There was no
moon. The water was black as ink. They
were all crowded into one flat-bottomed boat.
A wave would have thrown them all into the
lake. But there were no waves. The water
was still as the grave. He was crowded in
close to Joyce Mills. He could feel her very
heart beat. She said nothing but for all that,
he knew what she thought. She was thinking
of her father; of how he would love to be
here, and wondering a bit sadly where he was
and if he were living at all.</p>
<p>Had she but known!</p>
<p>The boat grounded at last quite noiselessly
on a sandy shore. A few whispered instructions
and they were away single file over a
winding moss-padded trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>At last the lights of the lodge began to shine
through the trees. They scattered, circling the
place. Weapons in hand, they waited. Came
the sharp command of the Federal officer. He
called upon those in the lodge to surrender.</p>
<p>All that followed will remain forever blurred
in Johnny&rsquo;s memory. A figure rose from the
bush to leap at Joyce Mills. Instinctively he
sprang at the figure. They went down together.
They rolled over and over, fighting
hard. For one brief second he was under,
pinned down. Cold steel pressed against his
temple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the end!&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>Then something, a gray shape, came hurtling
over him. A shot rang out, something
crashed into him. His light went out.</p>
<p>He could not have been unconscious more
than ten minutes. When he came to, the forest
was silent once more. A figure lay beside
him, a man with a gray beard, his figure enshrouded
in a long gray coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gray Shadow!&rdquo; he thought with a
start. &ldquo;At last he is still.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>Joyce Mills was hovering over him. When
he sat up dizzily, she gave a sharp cry of joy.</p>
<p>Heavy footsteps came crashing through the
brush. Drew Lane, Tom Howe and &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo;
were there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Drew demanded. &ldquo;They
surrendered tamely enough, old Greasy
Thumb and Three Fingers. The Chief was
with them and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief!&rdquo; Johnny could not conceal his
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and his whispering reporter. But
what is this? And who are these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed first to the Gray Shadow; then
to a dark form huddled in the weeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; played the light of his electric
torch on the dark huddled form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said impressively, &ldquo;is the Spy&mdash;the
worst man that ever lived. And he&rsquo;s done
for. Thank God! A bullet in his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; said Johnny, tearing away a
fake beard, &ldquo;is Newton Mills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, Joyce Mills threw up her
hands to utter a low cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see!&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; crowded in. He
played the light on the pale, blood-stained
face. He bent over it for an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one bring water,&rdquo; he said in a business-like
voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a scalp wound.
He&rsquo;ll be around directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny, watching Joyce Mills, admired her
more than ever. For, after all, it was her father,
the man she loved more than life, who
lay there before her. She swayed back and
forth once or twice; then turning to Johnny,
she said a bit unsteadily, &ldquo;I hope that we are
going to have chicken dinner together in the
shack to-morrow, father and Drew, Tom and
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not in the cabin that has seen love
and hate, life and death?&rdquo; asked Johnny, finding
it hard to control his emotions.</p>
<p>The hunting lodge was large. When Newton
Mills came to, he was comfortably stowed
away in one of its many beds. Joyce Mills
was left there with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>The others gathered about a great fireplace.
The prisoners, Greasy Thumb and his pal,
were not handcuffed. The windows were
heavily shuttered from without, and a Federal
officer sat on guard at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice night,&rdquo; said Johnny, seating himself
beside Drew Lane.</p>
<p>Across the fire the Chief scowled at him.</p>
<p>A radio was at Johnny&rsquo;s elbow. He turned
the dial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time to hear the Voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; started. The Chief&rsquo;s scowl
deepened. The whispering reporter moved
uneasily in his place.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Grace Palmer, the college girl,
had received a second mysterious letter. It
came this time by messenger. It read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The package you seek is hidden among the
rocks of the breakwater on the island, just at
the point where it turns from east to north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She read this with no little astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crown Jewels!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>She looked at her watch. It was nearly ten
o&rsquo;clock, a moonless night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>For a moment she hesitated, a moment
only. Then she went to the telephone.</p>
<p>She got Curlie on the wire. He was back
from his trip. She read the note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would you go there to-night?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With you, yes. To-morrow may be too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K. Meet me at the west entrance of the
12th Street Station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hung up. Five minutes later her car
slid out of the driveway and went gliding
down the boulevard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<h2 id="c34"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE PASSING OF THE VOICE</span></h2>
<p>A strangely tense bit of drama was
being enacted in that hunting lodge in
the north woods.</p>
<p>Johnny, you will recall, had turned on the
radio. For a space of three minutes they listened
to a familiar tune. Then, as Johnny
held up his watch, pointing to the hour of ten,
the place grew so silent that the far-away
throb of an outboard motor seemed strangely
loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Voice!&rdquo; Johnny announced huskily.</p>
<p>But the voice did not sound. A moment
passed; another and yet another. The silence
grew oppressive.</p>
<p>Then suddenly a voice boomed out with
startling clearness.</p>
<p>But what was this! This was not the old
familiar voice. And what was it saying?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are sorry to announce that there will
be no Voice to-night. A terrible thing has
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; started from his chair. The
Chief and his whispering reporter shrank into
the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Voice,&rdquo; the announcer continued, &ldquo;has
been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant there came a strange sputtering.</p>
<p>Something had gone wrong. Was it the distant
station or the radio at Johnny&rsquo;s elbow?
He turned the dial and at once there came to
the ears of the listeners the faint, mournful,
melodious notes of a pipe organ.</p>
<p>Ever endowed with a sense of what is fitting
in life, Johnny allowed this second station
to continue its sweet, sad dirge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is for the Voice,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;He
is dead.&rdquo; At once a feeling of infinite sadness
came over him. The Voice was dead. Little
enough he knew about this strange person and
yet he had come to love him, as had hundreds
of thousands of others. &ldquo;He was young,&rdquo; he
whispered, &ldquo;and now he is dead. The beautiful
world with its sunshine and flowers, its
singing birds and laughing children is lost to
him forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That every person in the room shared his
opinion, he did not doubt. It was a strange
situation. Perhaps the very persons who had
plotted the murder, yes, and paid well for it,
were in this very room. Greasy Thumb and his
confederates had committed deeds as evil in
the past. They appeared to cower now.</p>
<p>Then, too, there was &ldquo;The Ferret.&rdquo; He had
always displayed an extraordinary interest in
the Voice. What did he know of him? Was
he possessed of secrets hidden from the others?
Certainly at this moment he was behaving
strangely. The look on his face was a
terrible thing to see. Yet his manner was controlled.
Though small of stature and mean of
feature, &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; was every inch a man.
He had a brain that could think, a heart that
could feel, and a will that was ever in action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief,&rdquo; he said as he advanced to the corner,
&ldquo;you are going to resign! To-night! Now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>In his righteous indignation, the little man
appeared literally to tower. He pointed at a
phone.</p>
<p>The Chief, moving heavily toward the instrument,
called for long distance and asked
for a number. He waited while the clock
ticked three minutes away, then mumbled
some words too low to be understood, and returned
to his place. An hour later every radio
station in operation, and all the late newsboys
were announcing to the astonished city
that the Chief of Police had resigned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for you,&rdquo; said &ldquo;The Ferret,&rdquo; turning
his attention to the reporter, &ldquo;you are going
to vanish. You may choose your own method.
I&rsquo;ve enough on you for your double-crossing,
your play between honest work and the worst
form of double dealing, to put you away for
ten years. But you&rsquo;ve a good mother. I would
spare her. The Canadian border is but twenty
miles away.&rdquo; He pointed toward the door.</p>
<p>Gone was the smirking smile of the reporter
who had turned traitor, as he shuffled toward
the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the Chief has been crooked?&rdquo;
Johnny whispered, as &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; returned
to his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for me to say.&rdquo; The little man
sank deep into his chair. &ldquo;The city officials
can find out. It is their duty to find out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know is that he held up his hand and
in solemn oath swore to protect my boy and
every other honest boy in our great city. And
he failed! Failed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;your boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. My boy. Didn&rsquo;t you know? The fine
boy I introduced to you that night, who took
you for that long walk&mdash;that was my only
son. None ever had higher ideals and nobler
ambition than he. He was the Voice. And
now he is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant Johnny held up a hand. A
moment before he had turned the dial back. A
sound now came from the radio. The same
booming voice sounded again:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, you must pardon
the interruption. A thunderstorm crippled our
power station. We were off the air for a time.
As we were about to say, some time back,
there will be no message from the Voice to-night,
nor, indeed, on any other night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; sank lower in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; the announcer went on,
&ldquo;a terrible thing has happened. An attempt
was made upon this brave young man&rsquo;s life, he
who was known as the Voice. Fortunately,
this was an unsuccessful attempt. His wounds
are of little consequence. The assailant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; sprang up with a cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lives! He lives! Thank God, he lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assailant, Johnny gathered from what
followed, had been captured by a private detective
employed to guard the Voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who had betrayed the brave
youth, the man known to the underworld only
as the Spy, is reported killed in the north
woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank God! He is!&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo;
said fervently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the future,&rdquo; the announcer went on,
&ldquo;there will be no Voice. Those who have promoted
this noble undertaking feel that the
young man, whose name must remain unknown,
should not further risk his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now it is up to you, fellow citizens,&rdquo;
he went on earnestly, &ldquo;to carry forward the
work which he has so nobly begun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will!&rdquo; said &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; fervently.
&ldquo;They will! This is the dawn of a new day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for my friends, Drew Lane and Tom
Howe, there will be a new deal,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said &ldquo;The Ferret,&rdquo; &ldquo;a new deal; an
opportunity to use the talents they possess in
the service of their city.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<h2 id="c35"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">GOOD NEWS</span></h2>
<p>At midnight Johnny received a long distance
call from the city. Curlie was on
the wire. He and Grace Palmer, following the
tip from the mysterious note, had gone to the
breakwater and there retrieved the registered
package with its seal unbroken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they are all there, the jewels,&rdquo; Grace
Palmer broke in over his shoulder. &ldquo;The little
diamond and platinum train and all the rest.
And there will be a reward, such a reward!
Oh, how big! And we&rsquo;ll share it, we four,
Curlie, Joyce and you and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was you, Greasy Thumb, and your
gang!&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ferret&rdquo; said, after receiving the
good news. &ldquo;It was you, and not the radicals,
who robbed the Air Mail! And I haven&rsquo;t the
least doubt that it was your money the dead
Spy gripped in his hand! Blood money for betraying
my boy!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get your due now! We&rsquo;ll have
you before an honest judge. And the world
will not see you again until your hair is
white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>And so, before a great fire, they spent the
night, until dawn and a strong power boat
came together to light the waters and to bear
guards and prisoners back to the city.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Evening of that day found three people
standing before the cabin that had known love
and hate, life and death. There was a gray
haired man and a boy. And between them a
slim, dark-eyed girl. Johnny, Joyce and Newton
Mills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>Having recovered from his injuries, save for
a scalp wound that would soon heal, the veteran
detective had told, amid laughter and
tears, how he had concealed his identity under
a gray coat and whiskers so that he might
better play the part of protector to his young
friend, Johnny.</p>
<p>The affair in the tunnel had been a high spot.
He it had been who had warned Johnny and
saved him from drowning.</p>
<p>The affair of the glider among the clouds
was merely the result of a freak of fancy.</p>
<p>He had come alone to the north woods and
had arrived just in time to save the boy from
the murderous assault of the Spy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; asked Joyce as the three stood
watching the sun go down over the bay,
&ldquo;wrote those notes to Grace Palmer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;Perhaps
none of us ever will know. Some enemy
of Greasy Thumb, perhaps. Every bad man
has his enemies. And they are, more often
than not, his undoing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time after that there was silence.
Then, as she laid a hand gently on a shoulder

again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we go back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t go back.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice was

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
